This move could also drive innovation in AI, improve efficiency, and enhance customer experiences.

The potential benefits of this move, such as increased efficiency and competitiveness, should not be overlooked.

The impact magnitude is too positive in my view, as it overlooks the substantial cost of $50 billion.
