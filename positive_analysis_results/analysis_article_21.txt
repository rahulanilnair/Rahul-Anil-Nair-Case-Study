Headline Summary: ADP: Private Employment Increased 122,000 in December
Key Highlights: Private employers added 122,000 jobs in December
Final Sentiment: None
Confidence: 85%
Impact Magnitude: Medium
Agreement Level: Majority
Rounds to Consensus: 5

Rationale: risk_analyst: The slowdown in growth pace of 122,000 jobs in December indicates a potential slowing economy. The increase in private employment should be considered with broader economic data points. growth_analyst: The increase in private employment suggests a positive trend for the labor market. However, the slowdown in growth pace should be considered when evaluating the impact on the market. The significance of the word â€˜modestâ€™ and its implications on market impact suggest that the news will have some effect but its overall impact will be relatively contained compared to other economic data points. My proposed confidence rating of 82 reflects my nuanced view, which is a reasonable assessment given the mixed implications of this news. sentiment_analyst: The sentiment and confidence ratings seem too optimistic given the mixed implications of this news. The slowdown in growth pace should be considered when evaluating the impact on the market. A more neutral assessment would better reflect the nuanced view that the data points to a continuation of economic expansion but with some moderation. Key points: the significance of the word ',modest' and its implications on market impact.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 5 rounds. No full consensus reached. Final decision based on majority vote: {'Positive': 2, 'Neutral': 1}
