Rounds to Consensus: 2

Rationale: risk_analyst: While the Mahama administrationâ€™s commitment to revenue generation and alleviating economic burdens is understandable, I am skeptical about the overall sentiment of this analysis. The proposals seem overly optimistic and neglect potential risks such as inflationary pressures or tax avoidance strategies. Moreover, reducing taxes on citizens could lead to decreased government revenue. Additionally, expanding the tax base and implementing a 24-Hour Economy Policy are ambitious plans that may not have the desired economic impact without proper execution and oversight. A more nuanced view is necessary to accurately assess the implications of these policies. growth_analyst: While the current analysis presents a positive view of President Mahamaâ€™s commitment to revenue generation and its potential economic benefits, I disagree with this sentiment due to concerns about potential unintended consequences such as inflationary pressures or tax avoidance strategies. The proposed measures aim at alleviating the economic burden on citizens and creating sustainable jobs, but reducing taxes on citizens could lead to decreased government revenue. A more nuanced view is required to fully appreciate the implications of these policies. I propose a neutral sentiment due to this mixed nature of the current analysis. sentiment_analyst: The current analysis underestimates the potential risks associated with President Mahama's revenue generation strategy, including inflationary pressures and tax avoidance strategies. While the measures seem proactive, they may have unintended consequences that could impact the overall fiscal sustainability of the Ghanaian economy.
