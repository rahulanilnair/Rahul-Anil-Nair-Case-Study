Rounds to Consensus: 5

Rationale: risk_analyst: The minister congratulates India on its economic growth and transformation over the last 20 years. While this is a positive achievement for India, I partially disagree with the current confidence rating of 90% as some potential risks or challenges in trade negotiations and investments between India and Oman are not explicitly mentioned. The impact magnitude seems Medium rather than High due to ongoing CEPA negotiation and Indian investor interest on a medium scale. growth_analyst: While the minister congratulates India on its economic growth and transformation over the last 20 years and the sentiment is positive, I partially disagree with the current confidence rating of 90% as some potential risks or challenges in trade negotiations and investments between India and Oman are not explicitly mentioned. Additionally, while this is a significant achievement for India, the impact magnitude seems Medium due to ongoing CEPA negotiation and Indian investor interest on a medium scale rather than a high one. The growth analyst's assessment of 90% confidence and High impact magnitude may be overly optimistic given these nuanced aspects of the analysis. sentiment_analyst: The ministerâ€™s congratulatory remarks on Indiaâ€™s economic growth and transformation over the last 20 years align with a positive sentiment. Although some potential risks or challenges in trade negotiations and investments between India and Oman are not explicitly mentioned, the emphasis on digital transformation, science, and technology indicates a promising outlook for bilateral economic relations. The confidence level is reduced to 85% to account for these potential uncertainties.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 5 rounds. Consensus reached with 3/3 agents agreeing on Positive sentiment.
