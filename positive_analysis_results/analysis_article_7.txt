Headline Summary: Oil prices rise due to recent developments
Key Highlights: Oil prices rose more than 1% as China adopted looser monetary policy to boost economic growth, citing supporting risk appetite. Analysts noted that events in Syria added political uncertainty in the Middle East, providing some support to the market.
Final Sentiment: Neutral
Confidence: 70%
Impact Magnitude: Medium
Agreement Level: Strong
Rounds to Consensus: 2

Rationale: risk_analyst: While the recent developments in China and Syria did contribute to the oil price rise, there are still some risks involved such as global economic slowdown. The proposed impact magnitude of High is too speculative in my opinion. I partially agree with the positive sentiment, but a neutral stance reflects a more nuanced view of the situation, taking into account the potential risks and uncertainties involved. growth_analyst: While the recent developments in China and Syria did contribute to oil price rise, there are still some risks involved such as global economic slowdown. The proposed impact magnitude of High is too speculative in my opinion. I disagree with the current confidence rating of 90% as I believe a more conservative assessment should be taken into account. sentiment_analyst: I partially disagree with the current analysis as it seems too optimistic about the impact of recent developments on oil prices. While China's looser monetary policy may support economic growth, it also carries risks such as inflation and exchange rate fluctuations. Similarly, the events in Syria add uncertainty but also provide some support to the market, making a neutral sentiment more appropriate. My confidence level is moderate at 85% as I believe there are valid arguments for both sides. I propose a medium impact rating to reflect a balanced view of the situation.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 2 rounds. Consensus reached with 3/3 agents agreeing on Neutral sentiment.
