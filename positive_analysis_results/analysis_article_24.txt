Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: risk_analyst: I agree that the current sentiment is positive, but I partially agree with the confidence rating as it may be slightly higher than necessary. The proposed impact magnitude seems too medium considering the potential long-term effects of Ayotte's housing policies. growth_analyst: While the article highlights Ayotte's promises to address the state's housing crisis and promote economic growth, it also mentions concerns about her education policies. Therefore, I partially agree with the current sentiment but have a lower confidence level as some points are still subject to interpretation. sentiment_analyst: The article highlights Ayotte's positive initiatives and promises to address the state's housing crisis, including reducing approval times, re-purposing state property, and involving the public-private sector. While some advocates are cautious about her education policies, overall sentiment is generally optimistic. However, I do not fully agree with the current confidence and impact ratings because while Ayotte's promises seem promising, the actual effectiveness of these plans remains to be seen.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 3/3 agents agreeing on Positive sentiment.
