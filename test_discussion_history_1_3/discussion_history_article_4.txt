RISK_ANALYST:
  Stance: Partially Agree
  Proposed Sentiment: Neutral
  Proposed Confidence: 80%
  Proposed Impact: Medium
  Reasoning: While the record earnings surprise is a positive indicator, it does not necessarily mean the overall sentiment should be "Positive". The challenging industry conditions and high uncertainty surrounding the bank's performance in an increasingly virtual banking environment warrant a more cautious assessment. My confidence level reflects this consideration.

GROWTH_ANALYST:
  Stance: Partially Agree
  Proposed Sentiment: Neutral
  Proposed Confidence: 75%

SENTIMENT_ANALYST:
  Stance: Partially Agree
  Proposed Sentiment: Positive
  Proposed Confidence: 85%
  Proposed Impact: Medium
  Reasoning: I partially agree with the current sentiment due to the significant earnings growth.

While FirstState Bank's strong performance is notable, it doesn't necessarily indicate a broader positive shift in the industry
  Key Points: Record Q2 earnings, earnings growth of 45%, potential industry-wide implications

GROWTH_ANALYST:
  Stance: Partially Agree
  Proposed Sentiment: Positive
  Proposed Confidence: 70%
  Proposed Impact: Medium
  Reasoning: While the record earnings surprise is a positive indicator, I think itâ€™s essential to consider the challenging industry conditions and potential implications for the bankâ€™s performance in an increasingly virtual banking environment.
