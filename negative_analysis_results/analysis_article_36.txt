Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: risk_analyst: While the current analysis is generally negative due to the steady unemployment rate and its potential impact on interest rates, I partially agree with this sentiment. However, I think the overall economic outlook may not be as bleak as initially suggested. The increase in pay growth, particularly in the private sector, could indicate a strengthening labor market. Moreover, the fall in job vacancies is somewhat mitigated by the persistence of deflationary pressures on some industries. Therefore, my proposed sentiment remains negative but with lower confidence and impact ratings. growth_analyst: The current analysis highlights the steady unemployment rate and the decline in the FTSE 100, which suggests a negative sentiment. However, I partially agree with the current assessment as the article also mentions that pay growth picked up 5.2% per year, indicating some positivity. Furthermore, the fact that investors are now in wait-and-see mode, watching whether the labour market cools in the wake of the Budget, suggests a lack of confidence. Overall, I believe the impact on market sentiment is low as the article does not mention any significant effects on the economy or interest rates. sentiment_analyst: The current analysis suggests a negative sentiment due to the decline of FTSE 100 and steady unemployment rate, which could justify another interest rate cut by the Bank of England. However, I partially agree with the current assessment as it overlooks the potential positives from rising pay growth and private sector pay strength. Furthermore, the markets are currently pricing in a 93% chance of no change in interest rates, suggesting a cautious approach to long-term market implications. Additionally, the data showed job vacancies fell by 31,000 on the quarter, marking 29 months of consecutive falls but still higher than before the pandemic, indicating some vulnerability of the labor market.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 3/3 agents agreeing on Negative sentiment.
