Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: risk_analyst: While the current analysis highlights concerns over inflationary pressures and potential job market slowdowns, I believe the budget impact may have a moderating effect on wages growth. The jobs market present a confusing picture, with buoyant wage rises offset by mixed signals from survey data and recruitment reports. Higher national insurance and wages could lead to a ratchet effect, but also provide incentives for companies to control employment costs. I propose a negative sentiment with moderate confidence and high impact as the budget may exacerbate existing issues, but also offer opportunities for businesses to adapt. sentiment_analyst: While the current analysis highlights the negative impact of the Budget on bottom lines and jobs market signals, I believe the overall stance should be nuanced. The buoyant wage rises are a positive indicator for household spending power and apply upward pressure to prices. This could have long-term implications for the economy. However, the impact on companies' costs and potential job market slowdowns cannot be ignored. A Medium confidence level is assigned as some positive effects can be anticipated, but the overall negative sentiment remains dominant.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 2/3 agents agreeing on Negative sentiment.
