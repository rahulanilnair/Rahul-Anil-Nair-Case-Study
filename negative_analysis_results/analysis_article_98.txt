Headline Summary: FTSE 100 Declines As Wage Growth Accelerates
Key Highlights: U.K. unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.3 percent, average earnings growth at 5.2 percent, FTSE 100 down 50 points or 0.6 percent
Final Sentiment: Neutral
Confidence: 80%
Impact Magnitude: Medium
Agreement Level: Majority
Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: risk_analyst: While the FTSE 100 decline is a concern, the resilient U.K. labor market and steady unemployment rate suggest that interest rates may not be cut soon. The focus should be on understanding the nuances of the labor market data and its implications for interest rate decisions. sentiment_analyst: While the current analysis identifies a negative sentiment and medium impact on the FTSE 100 due to wage growth, I believe the situation is more nuanced. The accelerating wage growth and unchanged unemployment rate may lead to concerns about interest rate decisions, but this could also indicate a strengthening economy. Therefore, I propose a neutral sentiment and confidence rating, and a medium impact rating.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 2/3 agents agreeing on Neutral sentiment.
