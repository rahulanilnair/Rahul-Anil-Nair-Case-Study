Final Sentiment: Neutral
Confidence: 88%

Agreement Level: Majority
Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: risk_analyst: The current analysis indicates a neutral sentiment due to the moderate decrease in gas prices in the Meadville area, which is above state average. However, I partially agree with this assessment as the overall trend suggests that gas prices may be falling, but momentum is weakening and could be influenced by rising oil prices. I adjust my confidence level to 90%, considering the nuances of the situation. sentiment_analyst: While gas prices have indeed fallen in the Meadville area but remain above state average, this trend also indicates a weakening momentum for falling gas prices. However, this does not justify a drastic change in sentiment to Positive as oil price rises may limit further drops. Hence, neutral remains the most balanced stance, with reduced confidence compared to current analysis.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 2/3 agents agreeing on Neutral sentiment.
