Rationale: risk_analyst: While the negative sentiment is understandable given the decline in share price and potential disruptions, I believe the company\u2019s commitment to addressing the issues suggests a more optimistic outcome. The significant contribution of the Goa facility to revenue and the reaffirmed supply commitments to customers in the US mitigate the impact of the warning letter. growth_analyst: The negative sentiment is justified due to the decline in share price and potential disruptions to Indoco Remedies' operations. However, I partially agree with the current analysis as the significance of the Goa facility to revenue raises concerns, but Indoco Remedies' commitment to addressing the issues suggests a potential resolution.
