Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: risk_analyst: Although current sentiment and confidence ratings indicate a negative outlook, I believe the situation is more nuanced. The CEOâ€™s statement on preparing for the 2025 gardening season suggests a focus on long-term resilience. Additionally, cost savings measures can potentially mitigate the impact of declining sales. growth_analyst: While the company has issued another profit warning, which indicates challenging market conditions and reduced sales, I believe the negative sentiment is excessive. The CEO still expresses confidence in the company's cost savings and strong product portfolio for the 2025 gardening season. Additionally, Husqvarna has a history of issuing profit warnings without significantly impacting its overall performance. sentiment_analyst: While the current sentiment is negative due to the profit warning and challenging market conditions, I think the situation is not as severe as currently stated. The company has delivered on cost savings and prepares for a strong product portfolio in the gardening season.
