Rationale: risk_analyst: Overall, the current sentiment and confidence ratings seem too high given the stark decline in business sentiment indices.

This suggests that sentiment should be cautiously negative rather than strongly pessimistic. growth_analyst: The key points mentioned about declining business sentiment across various sectors and industry experts highlighting chronic economic weakness support a negative assessment. However, the expert opinions expressing optimism about a small expansion in 2025 and the awareness of structural headwinds suggest a nuanced view. Therefore, I disagree with the current negativity. sentiment_analyst: The current analysis presents a cautiously negative sentiment, confidence rate, and impact magnitude.
