Agreement Level: Majority
Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: risk_analyst: The current analysis highlights a potential sell signal due to declining average session volume and high debt-to-equity ratio. However, I believe there are aspects that suggest the company may not be in significant distress yet. For example, the 50-day moving average price is still above the stock's current price, indicating some level of support. Additionally, the company has a market cap of Â£44.73 million, which may provide sufficient liquidity to ride out short-term fluctuations. growth_analyst: While the company's declining average session volume and falling stock price do indicate a potential sell signal, I believe the current negative sentiment is premature. The stock has previously closed at GBX 1.17 ($0.01), which suggests some level of support. Furthermore, the debt-to-equity ratio of 0.39 may not be a concern for investors if the company can demonstrate its ability to manage and reduce this ratio in the future.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 2/3 agents agreeing on Neutral sentiment.
