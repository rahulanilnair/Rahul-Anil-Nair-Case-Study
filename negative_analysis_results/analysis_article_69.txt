Final Sentiment: Negative
Confidence: 78%
Impact Magnitude: Medium
Agreement Level: Majority
Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: growth_analyst: Although the current analysis indicates a negative sentiment and high confidence due to the decline in telecom stocks, I believe the sector is experiencing a temporary correction. The gains from Bharti Hexacom Ltd and Route Mobile Ltd suggest that some companies are adapting well to market changes. Additionally, the BSE Telecommunication index still maintained a positive momentum overall. Therefore, I propose a more neutral stance and adjust my confidence and impact ratings accordingly. sentiment_analyst: Our analysis suggests that the current negative sentiment is valid, given the decline in telecom stocks and the BSE Telecommunication index. However, we believe the impact should be considered medium rather than high due to the overall market context and potential for future resilience. Our proposed confidence level of 85% reflects our assessment of the situation as significant but not yet conclusive.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 2/3 agents agreeing on Negative sentiment.
