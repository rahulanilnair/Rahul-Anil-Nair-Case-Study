Final Sentiment: Neutral
Confidence: 70%
Impact Magnitude: Medium
Agreement Level: Strong
Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: risk_analyst: I partially agree with the current analysis that stamp duty changes may spark volatility in the 2025 mortgage market. However, I donkey rate the confidence level of 80% as relatively low considering the potential impact of stamp duty on transactions and subsequent market weakness. The predicted 2-4% house price growth in 2025 seems overly optimistic to me, given the historical effects of similar changes. Additionally, I believe the impact should be classified as High due to the potential for increased volatility and uncertainty among buyers and investors. growth_analyst: The current sentiment is neutral and confidence at 80%, which seems reasonable given the prediction of 2-4% house price growth in 2025. However, I think the impact rating of Medium might be slightly cautious considering the potential volatility caused by stamp duty changes. sentiment_analyst: While the current analysis is neutral due to economists predicting moderate growth and market strength,
