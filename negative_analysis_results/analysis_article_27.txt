Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: growth_analyst: The current analysis indicates a negative sentiment and a high confidence level of 90%, but I believe the language used is vague and lacks specifics. While the article mentions key events such as the Federal Reserve interest rate cut and rising Treasury yields, it doesn\u2019t provide an in-depth analysis of their impact on European shares. Additionally, the mention of investors awaiting central bank decisions introduces uncertainty, which could counterbalance the negative tone. Therefore, I don\t fully agree with the current sentiment, confidence, and impact ratings. sentiment_analyst: I Partially Agree with the current sentiment, confidence, and impact ratings due to the strong indication of a negative tone from the article. However, I do not entirely agree as there is some ambiguity regarding the central bank decisions' impact on market trends. The expected interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve and rising Treasury yields add to this negative tone, but investors are waiting for central bank decisions, which might indicate a degree of uncertainty.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 2/3 agents agreeing on Negative sentiment.
