Agreement Level: Majority
Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: risk_analyst: While the article highlights the negative impact of Ozy Media's collapse on the industry and its employees, I believe that the sentiment and confidence ratings are premature. The article also suggests that the industry is now chastened and prioritizing the needs of its audience over venture capitalists, which could be seen as a positive development. Additionally, the deflation of the industry has caused significant harm, but it also provides an opportunity for the media industry to adapt and evolve. growth_analyst: While the article discusses the collapse of Ozy Media and its downfall serves as a symbolic scapegoat for the media industry, I believe the current sentiment is over-negative. The industry has indeed learned from its mistakes and prioritized the needs of its audience over venture capitalists, which is a positive development. However, the situation is complex, and it would be premature to declare a new era without acknowledging both the progress made and areas for improvement.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 2/3 agents agreeing on Neutral sentiment.
