Rationale: risk_analyst: The current analysis has a negative sentiment and high impact, but I believe the article highlights the company's new 52-week low without presenting any positive news or analyst upgrades. This lack of information makes it challenging to determine the full extent of the stock price decline., growth_analyst: Although the company has reached a new 52-week low and trading volume is higher compared to previous days, I believe that this information alone does not indicate a significant decline in the companyâ€™s overall health. The provided financial data shows a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.35, quick ratio of 1.28, and current ratio of 1.46 which suggests a relatively solid capital structure. Moreover, the P/E ratio of 12.82 and a beta of 0.76 indicate that the stock may still have growth potential in the future.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 2/3 agents agreeing on Negative sentiment.
