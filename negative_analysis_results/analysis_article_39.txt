Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: risk_analyst: While I agree that the Bank of France lowering its economic growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% is a significant development, I think itâ€™s too negative. The revised forecast does take into account the impact of global instability and geopolitical risks, which suggests a cautious but realistic assessment. Furthermore, the prediction of rebalancing in 2026 and 2027 provides some optimism for future growth. growth_analyst: While the Bank of France's revised economic growth forecast for 2025 does indicate a more cautious outlook for the French economy due to domestic political turmoil and global instability, I disagree with the current sentiment that this news is 'Negative'. The forecast still expects rebound in 2026 and 2027, and inflation is predicted to remain below the ECB's target. Furthermore, the lowered forecast may create opportunities for policy makers to address the underlying issues contributing to economic growth. My proposed confidence level of 60 reflects my cautious optimism about the long-term implications of this news. sentiment_analyst: While the Bank of France lowered its economic growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% from 1.2%, citing domestic political turmoil and global instability as factors, their assessment may be overly pessimistic. The recovery in GDP growth expected in 2026 and 2027 to 1.3% suggests a more nuanced outlook than the current negative sentiment implies. Additionally, the Bank of France acknowledges that geopolitics are still present but do not account for trade tensions which could further impact French economy. This suggests some level of uncertainty and nuance not captured by the current assessment.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 3/3 agents agreeing on Negative sentiment.
