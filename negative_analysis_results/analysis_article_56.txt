Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: growth_analyst: The key content highlights cash burn as the primary reason for CureFit's increased consolidated loss. High advertising and promotion expenditure also contributed to this increase. sentiment_analyst: While the article reports a significant increase in CureFit's consolidated loss by 42% to Rs 888.5 crore, primarily due to high cash burn and increased advertising and promotion expenditure, I believe the current sentiment is overly negative. The company has raised over $750 million in funding so far, which indicates some level of market confidence despite the loss. Furthermore, CureFit's operating income has increased by 33.6% to Rs 926.6 crore, showing some resilience. However, high cash burn and restructuring efforts do highlight concerns for the company's financial health.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 2/3 agents agreeing on Negative sentiment.
