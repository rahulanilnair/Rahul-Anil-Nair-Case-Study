Rationale: risk_analyst: The current analysis presents a detailed view of the UK consumers' response to the rising cost of living in 2024. While the sentiment is neutral, I partially agree with it as it provides valuable insights into the cutbacks being taken by consumers. However, I find some points requiring more emphasis on potential long-term economic implications. The confidence level seems reasonable, and the impact magnitude seems moderate. growth_analyst: The current analysis states that UK consumers are taking cutbacks in response to the rising cost of living. I partially agree with this sentiment as it is supported by PwC UKâ€™s report, but my confidence level is lower due to potential biases in the data. The impact rating seems reasonable considering the economic implications of such actions. sentiment_analyst: The current analysis highlights the impact of rising cost of living on UK consumers, which is a neutral sentiment. However, considering the widespread nature of the issue and its potential long-term effects on the economy, I believe a more significant confidence level is warranted. The proposed impact rating seems reasonable given the emphasis on government support packages and the potential for inflation to rise. Nevertheless, I am not entirely comfortable with the Neutral sentiment and would propose a slight adjustment.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 3/3 agents agreeing on Neutral sentiment.
