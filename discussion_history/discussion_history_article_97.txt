The positive sentiment is supported by the increase in Jaguar Land Rover sales. However, the slight dip in commercial vehicle sales temper the overall optimism. growth_analyst: The company reported a one per cent year-on-year rise in global wholesales and growth in passenger vehicle sales. This improvement in overall performance justifies a positive sentiment. However, a moderate YoY dip in commercial vehicle sales temper the impact slightly. Confidence is high due to these improvements, but not at 100%, as it only accounts for Q3FY25 data. The proposed medium impact recognizes this moderate growth. sentiment_analyst: The company reported a one per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise in global wholesales, indicating a positive trend. However, the moderate impact rating seems reasonable given the one percent YoY dip in commercial vehicle sales.
