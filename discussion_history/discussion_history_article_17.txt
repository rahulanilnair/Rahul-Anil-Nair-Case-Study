However, there are concerns about risks involved in these segments that need to be considered. I partially agree with the current sentiment, confidence, and impact ratings but would like to refine them based on further discussion. sentiment_analyst: The current analysis presents a positive sentiment towards the recent trend of investors preferring mid- and small-cap funds amidst market volatility. The confidence level is high because of the strong inflows into these categories.
