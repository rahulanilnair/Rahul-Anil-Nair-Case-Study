Additionally, the impact of this event seems low considering the large jackpot potential for future draws. sentiment_analyst: The initial skepticism expressed by Robert Peak has a higher likelihood of being justified considering the low odds of winning and the high prize amount, which might be a scam if not claimed properly.
