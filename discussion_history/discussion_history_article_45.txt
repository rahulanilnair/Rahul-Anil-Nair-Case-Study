Additionally, while the emergence of hybrids sets a promising tone for CEEMEA bonds in 2025, it is essential to consider that these instruments are riskier prospect for investors than regular bonds. growth_analyst: The recent hybrid bond issuance by Aldar Properties and Africa Finance Corporation indicates a healthy CEEMEA primary market.
