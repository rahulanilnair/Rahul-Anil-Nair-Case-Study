SENTIMENT_ANALYST:
  Stance: Partially Agree
  Proposed Sentiment: Positive
  Proposed Confidence: 85%
  Proposed Impact: Medium
  Reasoning: The current analysis is positive due to the extended gains for a third straight session in gold futures and the dollar gaining marginally. However, the proposed confidence rating I agree with as 85 since the article mentions concerns about potential tariff hikes and geopolitical worries which could affect market sentiment. The impact rating I propose as Medium because while the gains are significant, they might not have long-term implications yet.
