A higher confidence level is warranted to reflect my agreement with the current analysis. sentiment_analyst: The current sentiment seems positive due to the governor's emphasis on transforming critical road networks and enhancing citizen living standards.

Therefore, my confidence would need to reflect that there is balance between progress and addressing underlying challenges.
