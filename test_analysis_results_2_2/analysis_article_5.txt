Rationale: risk_analyst: I disagree with the current analysis as I believe regulatory risks in China remain a significant concern for ByteDance. The company\u2019s strong revenue growth may alleviate some concerns but does little to address the underlying regulatory issues that have plagued it in the past. Furthermore, the lack of transparency in terms of their financial reporting and regulatory compliance raises red flags. Key points supporting my assessment could include the continued government crackdown on tech companies in China and the increasing scrutiny from regulators over data privacy and security. growth_analyst: While ByteDance reports strong revenue growth, regulatory risks in China remain a concern. The company has faced scrutiny from regulators, and this reporting period's financials do little to alleviate these concerns. I disagree with the current sentiment, confidence, and impact ratings as they seem too cautious given ByteDance\u2019s demonstrated resilience. 

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 2/3 agents agreeing on Negative sentiment.
