    "text": "Tokens like $DOGE, $PEPE, and $GIGA are notable for bringing audience participation and conversation. They are again in the news as top-performing tokens by social activity. Meme tokens maintain their stranglehold on the cryptocurrency market thanks to the use of social media platforms that can drive engagement and adoption.\n⚡️ TOP MEME Tokens by Social Activity$DOGE $PEPE $UFD #FARTCOIN $MLG $PENGU $SHIB $PNUT $BONK $GIGA pic.twitter.com/BY6WSLpvv7\n— 🇺🇦 CryptoDep #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 (@Crypto_Dep) January 9, 2025\nThe current analysis of meme tokens by LunarCrush shows a number of posts, engagement rate, and social influence. Tokens like $DOGE, $PEPE, and $GIGA are notable for bringing audience participation and conversation.\n$DOGE and $PEPE: The Titans of Meme Tokens\nNot surprisingly, $DOGE remains the dominant force in the meme token segment. From the analysis of social posts and interactions, $DOGE leads by a margin with 28.5K social posts and 6.94M interactions, with the highest social dominance score of 2.90%. $DOGE remained popular and engaging for its fans and users after introducing the idea of meme coins.\nClose behind is $PEPE, which rapidly gained popularity as a fan-favorite meme token. $PEPE attains an impressive social reach with 21.3K posts accompanied by 3.63M interactions and a social dominance of 2.20%. $PEPE has a playful nickname and a powerful presence on the Internet, making it one of the most recognizable tokens in the market. $DOGE.\n$UFD, $FARTCOIN, and $MLG: Gaining Ground\nAside from the giants, $UFD, $FARTCOIN, and $MLG are finding their positions in the world of meme tokens. $UFD enjoys 17.1K posts and 2.55M interactions and has a social dominance of 1.75%. The main factor of the appeal is its fun logo and the increasing number of stakeholders, making it one of the most promising tokens on the market.\n$FARTCOIN may sound quite ridiculous, but in terms of performance, it is not a joke. It created 12.4K posts and got 6.44M interactions, approximately on the same level as $DOGE regarding engagement rate. A social dominance of 1.20% suggests that this choice is becoming more popular. Likewise, $MLG posted 12.2K and received 4.22M interactions with the same dominance score of 1.20%. Such tokens demonstrate how meme coins can diversify by being creative and humorous to drive high user interaction.\nCommunity Favorites Meme Tokens\nThe meme token market primarily relied on community fervor, and tokens like $PENGU, $SHIB, $PNUT, $BONK, and $GIGA reflect this. While $PENGU garnered 11.7K posts and 2.11M total interactions, resulting in a social dominance of 1.10%, $SHIB recorded slightly more social dominance of 1.15% compared to $PENGU.\n$PNUT and $BONK were also notable; $PNUT received 7.01K posts, 1.32M interactions, and 0.70% social dominance score, while $BONK garnered 6.79K posts, 953K interactions, and a 0.70% social dominance score.\nMeanwhile, $GIGA has 6.45K posts, 6.35M interactions, and a 0.65% dominance level, which puts it on the list of top meme tokens. Combined with a large traffic volume per post, $GIGA should be considered a meme token with growth potential even though the total number of accumulated posts is significantly less than that of more popular tokens.\nThe Impact of Meme Tokens on the Crypto Market\nThe continued popularity and profitability of meme tokens clearly make them an essential part of the crypto space. $DOGE and $PEPE retain the highest popularity among users and are characterized by extremely active communities, while new entrants to the market, like $UFD, $FARTCOIN, or $MLG clearly indicate the desire of the market for new promising tokens.\nTokens like $PENGU, $SHIB, $PNUT, $BONK, and $GIGA also strongly push the significance of the bottom-up approach and social media as essential components for creating market relevance.\nThrough the integration of humor, a dose of creativity, and functionality, meme tokens have found their particular place in the market. These tokens will be able to participate and initiate their communities’ engagement and passion despite the market changes over time.",
