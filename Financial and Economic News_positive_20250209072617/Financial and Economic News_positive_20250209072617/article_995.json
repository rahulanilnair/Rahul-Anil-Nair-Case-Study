    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Sainsbury's, Britain's second biggest supermarket group, on Friday reported a 2.8% rise in underlying sales for the key Christmas quarter, with solid grocery sales offset by a weaker performance in general merchandise.\nThe group, which trails only Tesco by market share, said it expected to deliver full-year retail underlying operating profit, its preferred profit measure, in line with consensus and the midpoint of its guidance range of 1.01-1.06 billion pounds ($1.24-$1.30 billion), representing growth of around 7%.\n($1 = 0.8148 pounds)\n(Reporting by James Davey, Editing by Paul Sandle)\nShare Â© Reuters - 2025",
