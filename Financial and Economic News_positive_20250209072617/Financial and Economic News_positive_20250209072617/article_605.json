    "text": "Daniel Bragg claimed a top prize in the “Money Gift” scratch game at lottery headquarters in Clive after purchasing his winning ticket at Fareway in Newton. (Iowa Lottery) A Newton man is trading in his 2001 Chevy Suburban with 849,000 miles after winning a $150,000 lottery prize.\n“It’s a beater, but hey, it’s done pretty good,” Daniel Bragg said.\nHe drove that loud, red and rusty Suburban through a snowstorm to claim a top prize in the “Money Gift” scratch game at lottery headquarters in Clive. He bought his winning ticket at Fareway, 120 N. Third Ave. E. in Newton.\nBragg scratched the ticket on New Year’s Eve and had an immediate thought once he realized how much he won.\n“I’ve got to get a car, got to get a car,” he said.\nBragg, 46, said he plans to purchase a small pickup truck with his winnings. While he is excited to have some new wheels, Bragg said it will be bittersweet to part with a vehicle that has served him well.\n“Oh it’ll be a major upgrade. This vehicle, though, can still pull anything,” he said of his Suburban. “They said they built these like a tank, and yeah, it’s a tank!”\nFor more information about the promotion, visit ialottery.com .\nCOPY ARTICLE LINK Featured local savings Recent Articles\nDaniel Bragg claims $150,000 top prize in ‘Money Gift’ scratch game\nBeware of rise in ‘Grandparent Scams’\nNewton City Council postpones review of contracts with Hotel Maytag developer\nJasper County approves resurfacing of Quicksilver Avenue and Poplar Avenue\nJamie Grout brought on as producer for WHO morning show\nDaniel Bragg claims $150,000 top prize in ‘Money Gift’ scratch game\nBeware of rise in ‘Grandparent Scams’\nNewton City Council postpones review of contracts with Hotel Maytag developer\nJasper County approves resurfacing of Quicksilver Avenue and Poplar Avenue\nJamie Grout brought on as producer for WHO morning show",
