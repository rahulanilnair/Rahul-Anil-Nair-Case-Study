    "text": "<!–\n–>\n<!–\n–>\nOil prices rose more than 1% on Monday as top importer China adopted a looser monetary policy for the first time since 2010 in a bid to boost economic growth. This was reported by the Reuters agency.\nBrent crude futures rose 94 cents, or 1.32%, to $72.06 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose $1, or 1. 49%, to $68.20.\n“Easing monetary policy in China will likely be the driving force behind the oil price recovery, supporting risk appetite,” said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.\nTomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, said that “events in Syria have added a new level of political uncertainty in the Middle East, providing some support to the market.”\n#Oil #prices #rise #due #developments",
