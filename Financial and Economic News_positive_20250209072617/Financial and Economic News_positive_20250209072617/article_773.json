This could involve upgrading government hospital facilities, acquiring cutting-edge equipment and expanding specialised eye care centers. We also need to enhance funding for improving safety for medical staff, doctors and patients so that it improves overall functioning of the healthcare system.\nThere needs to be a focus on increasing support research and innovations in the healthcare sector. As a professional dedicated to the field of ophthalmology, there is a need to drive innovations in eye care treatments, surgical procedures, and the development of new technologies. This will help improve patient outcomes as well.\nThe government should also explore providing incentives for Public Eye Health Programs. There are several healthcare institutes that partner with NGOs to improve preventive and curative care for the eye health sector. The government should thereby also look at providing incentives to such institutes and NGOs.\nSurgical simulators are now being used for training post-graduate medical professionals. These simulators, although very expensive are highly effective in training professionals. Thus, the government could look at subsidising this technology for post-graduate training institutes. This will benefit future generations of doctors, especially surgeons in the long run.\nCurrently, there are several eye-care technology and machinery being imported from other nations. The government should thereby look at waving off duties on such sight saving equipment or provide incentives to manufacture such technology in the country.”\nSajeev Nair, Founder and Chairman, Vieroots:\n“As we approach the Union Budget 2025, the focus on preventive healthcare is more crucial than ever. At Vieroots, we believe that the future of healthcare lies in empowering individuals to take charge of their well-being through personalised solutions rooted in genetic and metabolic insights. This approach not only reduces the burden of lifestyle diseases but also enhances the overall productivity and quality of life for millions.\nThe upcoming budget presents an opportunity for the government to incentivise this shift towards proactive healthcare. Tax benefits for individuals investing in preventive health programs can encourage widespread adoption. Additionally, targeted support for health-tech innovations, especially in genomics and AI-driven personalised health, can position India as a global hub for cutting-edge wellness solutions. Public awareness campaigns highlighting the importance of personalised wellness can further transform health outcomes at a population level.\nA robust focus on these measures will not only strengthen India’s healthcare ecosystem but also foster a healthier and more resilient society. By aligning policy priorities with the potential of personalised wellness, we can create a sustainable, future-ready healthcare model that serves as a benchmark for the world.”\nVS Sudheer, Group CEO, Maxivision Super Specialty Eye Hospital :\n“With nearly 40 per cent of India’s population requiring primary eye care services annually—ranging from optical corrections to advanced surgeries—it is imperative to address the gaps in access and affordability. Advanced eye care services are still concentrated in Tier 1 cities, forcing Tier 2 and Tier 3 populations to travel long distances for specialty care. This disparity is particularly concerning as the 50+ age group, which will soon make up 50 per cent of India’s population, drives a surge in demand for cataract and diabetic eye care services.\nPrivate players dominate advanced eye care due to quick ROI in metro regions. To expand into underserved areas, the government must incentivise investments in Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns through subsidies for equipment, real estate, and streamlined approval processes under government schemes. Simplifying compliance and ensuring timely reimbursements under programs like PMJAY will encourage greater participation from private providers.\nHigh import duties on advanced technology and equipment make treatments costly. Lowering these duties or promoting domestic manufacturing through Make in India can significantly reduce costs. Supporting R&D, cross-border alliances, and skill development programs will help Indian manufacturers meet international standards and foster innovation.\nIndia faces a critical shortage of trained ophthalmologists, with only 20,000 practitioners serving a vast population. Of these, only a fraction is equipped to perform advanced surgeries. Subsidised training programs and mandatory skill-building initiatives for private institutions can help bridge this gap.\nAI-driven solutions hold immense potential for preventive eye care. India, with its vast data pool, can lead the way in predictive analytics if domestic companies receive support for innovation. Finally, broader insurance coverage, subsidies on essential imports, and environmental initiatives like afforestation will ensure affordable, sustainable, and equitable eye care for all.”\nBehram Khodaiji CEO Ruby Hall Clinic Pune:\n“With the Union Budget approaching, we are expecting reforms that will propel the healthcare sector forward and position India as a global medical tourism destination. Streamlining visa processes, providing tax benefits to international patients, and investing in infrastructure would further enhance India’s global appeal as the country continues to make significant strides in medical tourism. After exempting customs duties on selected cancer medicines in the previous budget, reduction in GST on medical equipment and consumables further would ease the burden on providers as well as patients, and hospitals would be motivated to use more advanced technologies. Improving accessibility would require a shift in focus on telemedicine solutions and digital health initiatives, especially in rural areas for equitable healthcare distribution. This budget can provide strategic investments and targeted reforms in the sector by focusing more on developing robust medical infrastructure through public-private partnerships and promoting hospital expansions in the wake of rising demand for specialised care and thus can make strides toward meaningful milestones both nationally and internationally to enable better health outcomes.”\n- Advertisement -\nMaxivision Super Specialty Eye Hospital National Institute of Ophthalmology (NIO) Ruby Hall Clinic Pune Union Budget 2025 Vieroots 0 46 Share EH News Bureau 11468 posts 0 comments Prev Post\nTata Capital Healthcare fund leads $20 million investment in Harsoria Healthcare\nNext Post\nUnion Budget 2025: Industry experts outline key priorities for India’s healthcare system\nYou might also like More from author Budget 2025 Union Budget 2025: Industry experts outline key priorities for India’s…\nNews Tata Capital Healthcare fund leads $20 million investment in Harsoria Healthcare\nGuest Blogs Lifestyle medicine and public health: A synergistic approach to preventing chronic…\nGuest Blogs Advisory for HMPV – Key preventative measures\nPrev Next Leave A Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n- Advertisement -\nNewsletter Subscription First Name\nLast Name\nEmail address:\nLeave this field empty if you're human: STAY UPDATED Facebook Likes Twitter Followers Youtube Subscribers Instagram Followers Linkedin Follow us RSS Subscribe - Advertisement -\nIndian Stents: Get Updated Season 2 - Advertisement -\nDigital Issue\nExpress Healthcare January 2025\n- Advertisement -",
