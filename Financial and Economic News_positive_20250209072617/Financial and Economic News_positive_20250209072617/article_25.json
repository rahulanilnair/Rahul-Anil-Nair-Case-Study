    "text": "In a decisive move by Exane BNP Paribas, Interpublic Group's stock (NYSE: IPG) has flipped from negative to positive as it was double-upgraded to Outperform from Underperform. The adjustment accompanies a bold price target of $38, hinting at a lucrative potential upside of more than 40%. This comes in light of the firm's scenario analysis, which predicates the significant upside on the fruition of anticipated synergies and an expansion of valuation multiples.\nWith 2024 having left holders of IPG nursing losses on the stock of more than 13%, a move to the upside, even close to that of the $38 price target would represent a huge turnaround story.\nIt's noteworthy that Exane BNP Paribas also expects Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE: OMC) to undertake a full share bid for Interpublic by the end of 2025. This expectation is casting a spotlight on 2025 as a potentially transformative “year of surprises” for the agency sector, according to the investment firm's analysis.\nAs of the latest metrics, Interpublic Group bears a market capitalisation of approximately $10.25 billion. The stock's performance depicted minor fluctuations, opening the trading day at $27.56, oscillating between a high of $27.61 and a low of $27.33. Despite the previous close at $27.70, the stock inched down to $27.53, marking a slight decline of 0.61%. Such figures seat the stock near the middle of its 52-week range, which spans between $26.88 and $35.17, attesting to its moderately stable performance amidst market dynamics.\n✓ Small-Cap Stocks With Huge Potential\nIf you're looking to add some small-cap stocks to your portfolio, then you need to see this.\nBefore you decide where to invest, you will want our special report on [5 Small-Cap Stocks To Consider](http://eepurl.com/inX_X-/).
