    "text": "News | Jan 10, 2025\nStaff report mail@aspentimes.com\nAspen residents can now apply for the city’s $132 food tax refund through a newly-launched online application process.\nThis initiative is open to individuals who lived within city limits throughout 2024 and were registered to vote in Aspen as of Jan. 1, 2024. The shift to an online platform aims to streamline administrative procedures and minimize paper waste.\nThe food tax refund, introduced to offset the cost of the city’s sales tax on groceries, requires applicants to meet several criteria.\nTo qualify, individuals must have maintained residency within Aspen city limits for the entirety of 2024 and ensured that their voter registration matched their current address during that period. Applications must be submitted by April 15; late submissions will not be accepted.\nThe program was originally created to encourage support for a sales tax referendum by reimbursing residents for the approximate amount of annual grocery sales tax. Those needing assistance with the application can visit the finance window on the second floor of City Hall at 427 Rio Grande Place.\nFor further information or to apply, visit aspen.gov . The application deadline is firm, closing on April 15 at 5 p.m.\nNews Aspen residents can now apply for city food tax refund Jan 10, 2025\nThis initiative is open to individuals who lived within city limits throughout 2024 and were registered to vote in Aspen as of Jan. 1, 2024.\nHigh Points: Young and hungry Jan 9, 2025\nA&E Agenda: Uphill breakfast club, Aspen Gay Ski Week, and TopHouse Jan 9, 2025\nClucking over egg shortages and rising prices?
