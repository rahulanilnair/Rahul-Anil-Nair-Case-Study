    "text": "Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd. (IREDA) has announced its financial results for the third quarter of FY 2024-25, showcasing significant growth across key financial metrics. As the nation’s largest pure-play Green Financing NBFC, IREDA has been focusing on publishing its Quarterly Audited Financial Results quickly, in this case within just 9-days.\nKey Highlights of Q3 FY 2024-25: Revenue from Operations : Achieved ₹1,698.99 crore, 35.57% increase compared to ₹1,253.20 crore in Q3 FY 2023-24. On a sequential basis, this is a 4.2% rise over the Rs 1630 crores revenue recorded in Q2, Fy25.\nProfit Before Tax (PBT): Stood at ₹538.20 crore, marking a growth of 39.38% from ₹386.14 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year\nProfit After Tax (PAT): Recorded ₹425.37 crore, reflecting 26.77% rise from ₹335.54 crore in Q3 FY 2023-24. However, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, growth has been just over 9%, when compared to the Rs 387 crores profit in Q2.\nLoan Sanctions: Amounted to ₹13,226.81 crore, a remarkable 45.01% growth compared to ₹9,121.11 crore in Q3 FY 2023-24\nIREDA Sanctions Up 129% In Q3, Disbursements Rise 41% Also Read Loan Disbursements: Reached ₹7,448.96 crore, up by 25.27% from ₹5,946.45 crore in the same period last year\nIndia Needs Over A Million Additional Engineers by 2050 for RE Vision: IREDA Chief Also Read Loan Book: Expanded to ₹68,959.61 crore, showing a 36.34% increase compared to ₹50,579.67 crore in Q3 FY 2023-24\nNet Worth: Strengthened to ₹9,842.07 crore, registering a 20.99% growth from ₹8,134.56 crore in Q3 FY 2023-24\nThe picture looks encouraging, as it should considering the rise seen in renewable capacity additions, tenders and projects in the pipeline as well. IREDA faces the challenge of meeting upto high investor expectations, something it has clearly set out to do by demonstrating strong governance norms. The challenge will be to maintain the kind of growth metrics it has demonstrated since the past year, as margin pressure and interest rate risks remain a real risk. Competition is also intensifying thanks to better access to capital markets for many of the larger borrowers, besides the improving abilities of banks and other financial institutions to evaluate green energy projects.\nQ2 Results: IREDA Reports 36% Jump In Net Profits Also Read Tags: Financial Results , FY25 , IREDA Q3 results , market research , profit increase , sanctions growth , share price",
