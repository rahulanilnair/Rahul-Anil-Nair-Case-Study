    "text": "Wilkes-Barre, Luzerne Co. — Wednesday the the state Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) announced a total of $5,503,981 in new Emergency Solutions Grant awards for organizations and municipalities across Pennsylvania to help combat the homelessness crisis.\nOne of the locations benefitting from the grant are the Clinton County Housing Coalition, Inc. who is receiving $245,000 to administer rapid rehousing, homelessness prevention, emergency shelter, and Homeless Management Information System activities for Clinton and Lycoming counties.\nCentral Susquehanna Opportunities, Inc. is also receiving $315,000 for street outreach, rapid rehousing, homelessness prevention, and Homeless Management Information System activities or Columbia, Montour and Northumberland counties.\nDanielle Keith Alexandre, the CEO of the Keystone Mission based in Wilkes-Barre and Scranton says state intervention is very helpful and important to help organizations fight homelessness.\n“It adds an extra layer of security support and support for the non-profit organization ns different companies that really do the work to help with the less fortunate such as the homelessness across Pennsylvania,” Alexandre said.\nThe Keystone Mission was not one of the beneficiaries included in the grant, but neighboring counties receiving these types of grants can ease stress off of other local organizations dealing with the homeless population from other counties.\nGovernor Shapiro also recently signed an Executive Order mandating the first comprehensive Housing Action Plan to address the state’s housing shortage, homelessness, and expand affordable housing options.\nSimilarly the Keystone Mission is also in the process of remodeling space at the Thomas C. Thomas complex in Wilkes-Barre to create apartments for four homeless families.\nAlexandre says this is an important next step to help more people get out of shelters and into temporary housing. She believes these grants will also be helpful during the colder weather as many homeless shelters see an uptick in clients during colder weather.\n“We have seen an increase also more so because we have the cold weather stint and the coldest days and weeks so we’ve definitely seen an increase,” Alexandre added.\nAside from state intervention, Alexandre says volunteering at local homeless shelters will also be a major help for the homeless population across the commonwealth.",
