Chisholm agreed to a one-year, $5.85 million contract with the Yankees on Thursday to avoid arbitration, Robert Murray of FanSided.com reports.\nChisholm lost his arbitration hearing with the Marlins for 2024 but was able to reach an agreement with the Yankees for the upcoming campaign. The 26-year-old primary played third base after being acquired by New York but could be moved back to second base in 2025. Chisholm had 24 home runs, 40 stolen bases and a .761 OPS in a career-high 147 games during the regular season last year.\nMore News Yankees' Jazz Chisholm: In cleanup spot again Wednesday 10/30/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Yankees' Jazz Chisholm: Sitting out finale 09/29/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Yankees' Jazz Chisholm: Launches 24th homer 09/29/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Yankees' Jazz Chisholm: Making push for 40 steals 09/22/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Yankees' Jazz Chisholm: Getting breather against LHP 09/21/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Yankees' Jazz Chisholm: Homers, swipes bag 09/20/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Baseball Stories What you missed after football started Scott White • 27 min read Bust scenarios for first-rounders Chris Towers • 14 min read Tracker: Giants land Verlander Scott White • 51 min read Top 150 Dynasty rankings Scott White • 1 min read Lux trade raises questions in Cincy Chris Towers • 4 min read First look at 2025 rankings Chris Towers • 8 min read",
