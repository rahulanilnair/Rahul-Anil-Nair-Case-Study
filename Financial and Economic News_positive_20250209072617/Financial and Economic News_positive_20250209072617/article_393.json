(TSX.V: PEI, OTC: GXRFF) is pleased to announce the appointment of Darren Jackson as Chief Operating Officer (COO). This leadership role took effect at the start of the year, marking an important step for the company. Jackson comes with a wealth of experience—over 25 years in the oil and gas industry—bringing invaluable insights that are expected to drive operational excellence and strategic initiatives at Prospera.\nRecent Financial Developments\nIn recent financial news, Prospera has successfully completed a non-brokered unit offering, raising $900,000. Each unit is priced at $1,000 and incorporates a one-year secured promissory note, accompanied by lucrative common share purchase warrants. This capital infusion is designated for production optimization and to bolster general working capital.\nUnderstanding the Investment Structure\nThe structure of this investment allows subscribers to benefit from a 5% gross overriding royalty (GORR) on revenue generated from Prospera properties. This revenue is tied specifically to production levels exceeding 1,363 barrels per day. The GORR is subject to approval from the TSX Venture Exchange and is designed to enhance investor returns as production increases.\nEquity Financing through Share Issuance\nAdditionally, Prospera has initiated a strategic move to settle a critical trade payable with a vendor, valued at $167,972. This will be achieved through the issuance of approximately 3.36 million common shares, estimated at a price of $0.05 per share. While this transaction is classified as a non-arm’s length transaction, it strengthens the company's balance sheet and allows for better cash flow management.\nAltering Warrant Terms to Benefit Investors\nIn a proactive approach, Prospera has also amended the terms of 15.33 million outstanding warrants. By extending the maturity date by a year and reducing the exercise price to $0.06, Prospera is making it easier for investors to capitalize on their investments. This move is crucial for improving the company’s cash flow and supporting vital expenditures.\nAbout Prospera Energy Inc.\nProspera Energy Inc. is a dynamic Canadian energy company focused on the exploration, development, and production of crude oil and natural gas. With its headquarters in Calgary, Alberta, Prospera is committed to utilizing environmentally friendly methods to enhance recovery from legacy fields. The core properties of the company are strategically located across Saskatchewan and Alberta, including notable sites like Cuthbert, Luseland, Hearts Hill, and Brooks.
