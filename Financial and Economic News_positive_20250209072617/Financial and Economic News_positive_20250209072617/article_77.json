Its \"wealth and size\" played a part in its \"EV success\" – it has a population of 5.5 million and is one of the world's richest nations, thanks to substantial oil and gas reserves, ironically.\nNorway \"penalises\" petrol and diesel cars with \"high taxes\", said Reuters , and exempts EVs from import and value-added taxes to \"make them more attractive\", although \"some levies\" were reintroduced in 2023. EVs have been exempt from road tolls and parking fees and were allowed to use bus lanes in and around the capital, Oslo.\nThe approach has worked because it has been \"consistent over time\" and maintained by governments of \"various political persuasion\", said the outlet, in contrast to other countries where \"someone puts tax incentives or exemptions and then they pull back again,\" said Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian EV association.\nOffering incentives, rather than banning petrol and diesel cars , has also helped, said the outlet, and another advantage is that Norway \"does not have an automaker lobby\". Norway's power grid is \"one of the greenest and most robust in the world\", said DW, and usually produces a \"surplus of energy\", which helped ease the home charging of EVs.\nAmbitious goal Norway has set a target for all cars sold to be zero-emission vehicles by the end of 2025, a milestone that would put it a decade ahead of the European Union, of which it is not a member.\nBut \"reaching that ambitious goal\" will \"likely be a difficult task\", said Quartz. Øyvind Solberg Thorsen, from the Norwegian Road Federation, said that \"the figures and the increase in share show that the last few percentages\" to meet the 2025 target may be \"difficult to achieve\".\nWhile nearly all new buyers of cars in Norway have gone electric, \"some hold-outs remain\", noted Reuters, particularly among rental companies, which prefer to use cars that are familiar for tourists.\nExplore More Electric cars Climate change Norway Sign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors By submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.
