    "text": "Quick Summary: This undoubtedly remains a possibility, considering how Solana dominated last year in terms of network activity. Dawson warned that other layer-1 networks are challenging Ethereum’s market share, although he added that this may offer higher risk and reward opportunities. ETH Still Bullish Despite Recent Market Downtrend Crypto analysts have suggested that Ethereum still has a bullish outlook despite the recent market downtrend.\nHe predicted that the second-largest crypto could rally to as high as $12,000 and explained how the Pectra upgrade could contribute to the parabolic rally. Ethereum To Reach $12,000 Thanks To Pectra Upgrade And Other Factors Dawson predicted that Ethereum could reach $12,000 by the end of the year thanks to the Pectra upgrade, Donald Trump’s presidency, increased adoption, and a surge in ETF inflows.\nThe analyst added that if the support holds, a breakout with a bullish target of $4,100 could be expected.
