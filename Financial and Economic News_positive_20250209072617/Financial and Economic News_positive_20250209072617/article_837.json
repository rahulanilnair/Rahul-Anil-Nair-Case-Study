So hopefully that can continue.' Photograph: Bryan Keane/Inpho Gerry Thornley Fri Jan 10 2025 - 06:00\nWhen Tom Ahern and Munster agreed to the Waterford man’s latest two-year contract extension, both player and province alike must have done so in the fervent belief that these should be the best years of his career to date.\n“Over the moon” about his new deal with his home province, as his versatility demonstrates, the rangy, athletic, 6ft 9in lock/blindside flanker is a rare talent. After two years on the Irish Under-20s as well as an Emerging Ireland tour in 2022 and call-ups to the A and full Irish squads, the 24-year-old has still to make the breakthrough into international rugby.\nThe back five in the pack is a seriously competitive area of course, and 53 caps in 4½ seasons with Munster is not a bad return, albeit 26 have been starts and 27 off the bench.\nIt’s also worth noting that Ahern missed virtually all of the 2022-23 season after undergoing shoulder surgery. Then, last June an ankle injury sidelined him for Munster’s URC run-in after he had played 23 games last season. Having trained with the Ireland squad, the injury also ruled him out of consideration for the summer tour to South Africa.\nREAD MORE The Counter Ruck: the rugby newsletter from The Irish Times",
