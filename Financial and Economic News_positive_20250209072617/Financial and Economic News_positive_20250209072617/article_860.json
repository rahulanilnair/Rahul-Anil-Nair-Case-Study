    "text": "The seasonally adjusted estimate in November rose 3.0 per cent compared with November 2023. There were rises in all retail industries in November. Of the non-food related industries, department stores rose 1.8 per cent, followed by clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing (+1.6 per cent), household goods retailing (+0.6 per cent), and other retailing (+0.3 per cent), said ABS in a press release.\nBoth food-related industries also saw growth. Cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services rose 1.5 per cent, its fourth straight monthly rise, while food retailing rose 0.5 per cent.\n“Black Friday sales events proved once again to be a big hit, with widespread discounting and higher spending across all retail industries,” said Robert Ewing, head of business statistics at ABS. “The popularity of Black Friday sales continues to grow with promotional activity now stretching across the entire month of November, not just solely focused on the Black Friday weekend.”\n“Consumers have taken advantage of Black Friday sales once again, with discounting seen across clothing items, furniture, electrical goods and cosmetics. Discounts were also seen in essential goods, with businesses in food retailing boosted by higher spending due to Black Friday price cuts and points incentives through rewards programs,” Ewing further said.\nIn November, seasonally adjusted sales for clothing, footwear, and personal accessory retailing increased by 1.6 per cent, amounting to $47.0 million. Within this category, clothing retailing rose by 1.4 per cent ($29.5 million), while footwear and other personal accessory retailing saw a 1.8 per cent increase, contributing $17.5 million.\nIn November, sales at department stores rose 1.8 per cent ($33.7 million), and other retailing rose 0.3 per cent ($16.7 million) in seasonally adjusted terms.\nThe total online retailing sales were $4,182.6 million in November 2024, in seasonally adjusted terms. Seasonally adjusted online sales rose 1.2 per cent ($47.6 million), following a rise of 1.1 per cent ($43.1 million) in October 2024. Seasonally adjusted through-the-year sales are up 8.7 per cent ($333.0 million). Original online sales rose 21.8 per cent ($944.5 million) compared to a rise of 26.9 per cent at the same time last year.\nFibre2Fashion News Desk (SG)",
