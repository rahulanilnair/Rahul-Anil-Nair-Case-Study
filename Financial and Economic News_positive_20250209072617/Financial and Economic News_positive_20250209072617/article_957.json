    "text": "The Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, has said that the Federal Government has paid N22 billion as compensation to displaced communities in the country’s 700-megawatt hydroelectric power project in Zungeru, Niger State.\nAdelabu disclosed this recently when he met with the Compensation and Resettlement Committee of the Zungeru power plant in his office in Abuja.\nThis comes as Adelabu assured the release of funds to communities yet to be compensated, which, according to him, amount to around N2.2 billion.\nAccording to Adelabu, at the commencement of the Zungeru power project, 133 communities were identified for compensation or resettlement, but he said the number has plummeted to over 300.\n“I’m happy that we have been able to pay N22 billion out of the compensation, and from our records, we have N2.2 billion remaining for payment. Some new figures have been presented here today, but we will have to go back as a ministry to verify these claims.\n“Let us all bear in mind that the Federal Government is facing a paucity of funds. There are many issues competing for government attention, and we have to address them according to what is available to us in terms of revenue,” he said.\nMeanwhile, Adelabu decried that the number of communities earlier earmarked for compensation tripled.\nAccording to him, the government needs to verify the numbers of affected communities before a fresh round of compensation is released.\n“However, it is a big surprise here to me that some communities are being added afresh to those who should be compensated or resettled,” he stated.\nRecall that in March last year, a court in Minna, Niger State, ordered the federal government to pay N1.1 trillion as compensation to displaced communities in the Zungeru power plant project.",
