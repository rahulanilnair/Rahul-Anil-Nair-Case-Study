He emphasised that no assurances had been given to reduce electricity prices immediately and urged patience as the government works toward achieving this goal.\nResponding to a query raised by Kurunegala District SJB Parliamentarian Dayasiri Jayasekara, Minister Jayakody said, “Our goal is to reduce electricity tariff. However, we never claimed that would be done in a day or two; it will take up to three years. The public is currently bearing the consequences of corruption under the previous administration. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is burdened with Rs. 332 billion in debt due to excessive purchases of electricity at higher rates. Addressing these issues systematically is our priority.”\nThe Minister also noted that the CEB had initially proposed a 37% tariff hike, but the government had revised the proposal to minimise its impact. “We need to clear the lingering burdens from the past. We will not offer projects to associates or friends but will focus on implementing necessary reforms to lower electricity tariffs,” Jayakody assured.\nMP Jayasekara highlighted earlier promises made by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who pledged to reduce electricity tariffs by 35% within a short period and lower the cost for households consuming 5,000 units from Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 3,000. “These promises influenced voters, but now the CEB says tariff reductions will not be possible until June. Small-scale industries are collapsing under the burden of excessive electricity costs,” he said.\nJayasekara also accused the government of failing to deliver on its promises and questioned the CEB’s reported profit of Rs. 167 billion, demanding clarity on when the issues would be resolved. “Over 56% of the electricity supply comes from hydropower, yet the public continues to suffer from high costs,” he remarked, calling the government a “fraudulent administration.”In response, Minister Jayakody denied that the government had absorbed any of the CEB’s debts and reiterated the need for systemic reforms to address the challenges in the energy sector.\n[News](http://island.lk/category/news/)\nEleven dolphins die after being caught in fishing net\nBy Dinasena Ratugamage\nWildlife officers in Mullikulam, Mannar, found 11 dead dolphins on Wednesday (08).\nWildlife veterinary surgeons Chandana Jayasinghe and W.L.U.
