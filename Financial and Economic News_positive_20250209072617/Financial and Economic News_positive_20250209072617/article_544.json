    "text": "By Abigail O'Leary ,\n57 minutes ago A lottery winner shared some wise words after learning he has won big and driving his car with 850,000 miles on the clock to collect his prize.\nDaniel Bragg of Newtown, Iowa, scooped $150,000 in the \"Money Gift\" scratch game which he purchased on New Year's Eve. The 46-year-old soon found out his 2025 had got off to a brilliant start as he revealed his winnings - before hopping in his 2001 Chevy Suburban with 849,000 miles to collect his money.\nBragg said he drove his \"loud, red and rusty\" Suburban through a snowstorm to collect his win , adding: \"It's a beater, but hey, it's done pretty good.\" But despite saying it would be tough to part with his trusty set of wheels, Bragg added: \"I've got to get a car, got to get a car.\"\nREAD MORE: Delivery driver who scooped $50,000 Powerball win names heartbreaking reason he would give it up\nREAD MORE: Indiana couple discovers $1M Powerball ticket on Christmas Day just hours before it expires\n\"Oh it'll be a major upgrade. This vehicle, though, can still pull anything. They said they built these like a tank, and yeah, it's a tank!\"\nIt comes after a UPS driver said he stood and cried after realizing her had won big with a Powerball ticket - but said he would give it all up just to have one wish granted.\nJeffery Goree purchased his winning Powerball ticket at Clark’s Pump-N-Shop on Versailles Road in Lexington while stopping during a day of deliveries - a job he does five days a week. After checking his ticket several days after the December 14 draw, Goree discovered he matched four white balls - scooping an incredible $50,000.\nSpeaking to the Kentucky Lottery , Goree said: “I was checking them. I had about 15 tickets to check and was down to the last two tickets. It showed, ‘Congratulations, you won $50,000, contact KLC Corp’. I said, \"Man, this machine is messed up.\"\nRefusing to believe his luck, Goree took the ticket up to the store clerk and asked him to check, assuming the machine had made an error. Goree added: “Next thing I know he’s telling me, ‘Congratulations. All I could do was stand there and cry.\"\nGoree received a check for $36,000 after taxes - but said the money could never compare with one wish he would exchange it all for - seeing his mother just one more time after her death three years ago. When asked what he planned to do with the winning, Goree said: “I would give this money up if I could get just one more Christmas with my mother.\" Clark’s Pump-N-Shop will receive $500 for selling the winning ticket.\n20",
