    "text": "Sensex, Nifty open higher as TCS leads IT rally with 5% jump in early trade\nThe S&P BSE Sensex gained 206.33 points to 77,826.54, while the NSE Nifty50 added 45.90 points to 23,572.40 as of 9:19 AM.\nBenchmark stock market indices opened higher on Friday, fuelled by a surge in IT sector stocks with TCS leading from the front, gaining nearly 5% in early trade on the back of good Q3 FY25 results.\nThe S&P BSE Sensex gained 206.33 points to 77,826.54, while the NSE Nifty50 added 45.90 points to 23,572.40 as of 9:19 AM.\nDr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services said that in the context of the looming uncertainty regarding President Trumpâ€™s likely actions, the market is unlikely to rally in the near-term.\n\"There appears to be no respite to the sustained FII selling which touched Rs 7170 crores yesterday. This will continue to put pressure on the market. Since the results season has started the market will witness lots of stock-specific action in response to the results. Results of TCS indicate that the IT sector will continue to remain resilient,\" he added.\nResults of banking majors will be good but in the context of FII selling the sector may not perform in response to the results. Pharma and select auto stocks like Eicher, M&M and Bajaj Auto are potential outperformers in a weak market.",
