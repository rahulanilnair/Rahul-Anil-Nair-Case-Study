    "text": "Cork man Mike O'Sullivan, director of asset management firm Unio, believes while Ireland faces many challenges, most notably inflation, the country is still very competitive compared to many other European countries Mike O'Sullivan is director and strategic adviser with Unio.\nFri, 10 Jan, 2025 - 02:00 In conversation with John Daly  \n    MY JOB\nName : Mike O’Sullivan\nOccupation : Director and strategic adviser, Unio\nBackground : Unio has more than 300 employees and oversees €14bn of assets on behalf of personal and corporate clients.\nIn his role as director and strategic adviser to Unio, Mike O’Sullivan chairs the Unio Global Macro Council and Investment Committee. With more than 20 years’ experience in global financial markets, most recently as CIO in the International Wealth Management Division of Credit Suisse, he is an expert in European financial policy, having worked with several EU fintech firms.\nEducated at UCC and Balliol College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, he has taught finance and economics at Oxford University and Princeton University. A native of Cork, now living in Paris, he is the author of The Levelling , which outlines economics, finance and geopolitics in the post-globalisation era, and also made the BBC 4 radio documentary, Waking up to World Debt .\n“If I had to pick one way in which Ireland is different to other countries, I would say that while it is an old country, it has a young society and younger economy, in terms of structural development,” he says, referencing Joe Lee’s book on Irish history, which speaks of a long history of economic underachievement.\n“I illustrate this to people with a chart of Irish GDP compared to that of Britain, starting in 1800 up to today. What it shows is a very long period of economic underdevelopment, right up to 1990, when the Berlin wall fell, globalisation kicked off and Ireland rode its coattails.\n\"Since then, Ireland has become a wealthy country, but the fact that it has happened quickly, and in a boom-and-bust style, means that the investment infrastructure and culture of infrastructure that you might find in older economies — from Sweden to France — is not yet there.”\nWhile personal wealth has grown significantly, with the number of people with net assets of over €1m having doubled in the last decade, Ireland is under-served in terms of wealth management advice.\n“As a trusted wealth adviser, Unio’s goal is to move our clients from being passive wealth holders to active wealth builders.\n\"In this context, Ireland has a lot of upsides because we are at the beginning of a generational transfer in wealth, one that hopefully becomes more meaningful in the ways it can help Irish firms to grow. The challenge is to get policymakers to take a very fresh look at the way investment works in Ireland,” he adds.\nChallenges facing Ireland\nLooking at the more significant challenges facing Ireland in the future, his instinct is to look beyond 2025. “I think the biggest economic issue will be inflation — and to focus on reshaping our economic model so that it enables Ireland to advance in terms of economic sophistication and as a society. We need a longer-term investment model, more Irish growth companies and a complete overhaul of infrastructure.\nThe issue Ireland faces is not a lack of money, but a lack of know-how in planning and executing infrastructure projects — which is something other peer countries like Denmark and Sweden have.\nIreland has done very well from globalisation, but he points out this is changing fast: “As the ‘tide goes out’, Ireland is being exposed in terms of its lack of defence and security capabilities and a total absence of geopolitical and security alertness in our political class.\n\"It worries me that, in the same way, Ireland was unprepared for the 2008 economic collapse, we are similarly unprepared for a rougher, chaotic world order.”\nThe investment landscape is profoundly influenced by both global and local politics, he says, where diplomatic relations, regional conflicts and political stability all shape investor sentiment and market dynamics.\n“At Unio, understanding this interplay is key to navigating financial markets and helping clients maximise their financial lives and futures.”\nGiven how 2024 delivered political and economic turbulence to the eurozone, with its largest economies, Germany and France, facing significant challenges, Mike O’Sullivan takes an optimistic view.\n“It seems to me that, in a volatile way, the eurozone has become stronger institutionally through every crisis that has befallen it — Brexit and covid being the latest examples.\n\"However, across the EU, France and Germany are ‘unwell’ economically, but there is an important power shift to the east, notably the Baltic states and Poland, and Spain is growing strongly.\n\"I would say that the one element of the European debate that is not felt in Ireland is the need to prepare industry, the technology sector and militaries for conflict with Russia. Denmark, for example, has just added €5bn to its military budget.”\nGlobal uncertainty\nWith incoming US president Donald Trump taking office on January 20, and general anticipation of more global uncertainty, Ireland’s position is better than that of many of our EU neighbours.\nIn some respects, it is too late to worry — we have known for some time that the economy is over-reliant on foreign direct investment, but policy has not reacted to this. Having said that, those multinationals are deeply embedded in our economy, so a sudden exit is unlikely.\n\"In addition, in other ways, Ireland is still a very competitive economy compared to many EU neighbours,” he says.\n“I think the recent election was a good example of how grounded and local Irish politics is, and that is a good thing. There are other elements of Irish democracy — like the citizens' assembly — that are also admirable. Yet, lower turnout is a worry, as is the impact of social media on public life and the quality of political debate across the world.\n\"The other element that needs to be balanced is that our political system rewards politicians for focusing too much on local issues, often to the detriment of the ‘bigger picture’.\"\nWhile maintaining continued contact with his native Cork, Mike readily admit that living in the ‘City of Light’ does have its moments.\n“It’s a wonderful place to live. We are right in the city centre so have witnessed many of the events that define Paris — including the fire at Notre Dame and the Olympics. The city is thriving and very livable.”\nRead More Ireland needs to 'stimulate innovation' to grow the financial services sector, report says\nMore in this section\nTesco sees sales over Christmas jump 4.8% to €1.4bn Corporate insolvencies expected to surpass 1,000 during 2025 Profits at data centre builder Ardmac surged before sale to Portugal-based group  Business movers: People starting new jobs in Ireland READ NOW Subscribe Now",
