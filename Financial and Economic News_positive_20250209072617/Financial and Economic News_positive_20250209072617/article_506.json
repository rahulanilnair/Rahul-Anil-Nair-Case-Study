These platforms have solidified their dominance, driving a significant portion of the market's investor expansion. By December 2024, the NSE’s active investor base had grown by 44 percent year-on-year, reaching 5.01 crore accounts. Among the new additions, Groww led the way with 60.66 lakh new investors, representing 40 percent of the total. Angel One followed with 26.56 lakh new investors, accounting for 17.5 percent, while Zerodha added 15.2 lakh accounts, contributing 10 percent of the overall growth. This impressive expansion is largely attributed to a robust market rally, with indices like the Nifty 50, Nifty Midcap 100, and Nifty Smallcap 100 delivering strong gains.
