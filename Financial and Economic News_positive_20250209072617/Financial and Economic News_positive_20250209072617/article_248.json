    "text": "Science labs in colleges set for major upgrade after year-long fund drought\nBhubaneswar: Addressing a critical funding gap that persisted since the 2022-23 academic year, the [higher education department](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/higher-education-department) has initiated a comprehensive plan to modernise science laboratories in 152 aided colleges across the state. In a significant move announced on Thursday, the department directed college principals to submit detailed requirements for laboratory equipment, marking the end of a prolonged period during which these institutions struggled to maintain and upgrade their science lab facilities.\nThe modernisation drive will cover four core science subjects- physics, chemistry, botany and zoology. Colleges have been asked to provide specific lists of required apparatus, chemicals, glassware and specimens by January 13. \"Proposals received after the due date may not be considered,\" said Sujit Kumar Panda, under-secretary of the higher education department, in a letter to principals.\nThe program will benefit aided colleges across 27 districts, with Cuttack district having the highest number of participating institutions at 13, followed by Ganjam with 12 colleges. Both Puri and Mayurbhanj districts have 11 colleges each under the scheme, while Khurda district accounts for 10 institutions.\nThe funding drought particularly affected final-year students who require advanced laboratory exposure for their practical examinations and research projects. The new initiative is expected to bridge this gap and bring laboratory facilities up to current educational standards, said a college principal.",
