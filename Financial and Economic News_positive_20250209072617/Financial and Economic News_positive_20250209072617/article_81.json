    "text": "Essex man claims $50,000 prize on Gold Bar Bingo instant ticket\nAfter 20 years as a cosmetologist, a lucky Baltimore County man can retire, thanks to a life-changing Lottery win. The Essex resident bought a $5 [Gold Bar Bingo 5th Edition](https://www.mdlottery.com/scratch-off/gold-bar-bingo-702) scratch-off on Jan. 2 that carried a $50,000 top prize.\nHe selected the instant ticket at Crazy Mart, his regular Lottery retailer, located at 1705 Pennsylvania Avenue in Baltimore. The loyal player sometimes plays [Mega Millions](https://www.mdlottery.com/games/mega-millions/) and [Powerball](https://www.mdlottery.com/games/powerball/) but on this particular day, he was destined for a winning scratch-off.\nHe revealed the big win the day of his purchase and thatâ€™s when the celebration began. He stood up and started jumping about while simultaneously his hands shook in excitement. Later, he shared the great news with his family and some work friends.\nSome of the funds will go toward preparing for and enjoying retirement, the happy winner said.\nHis lucky retailer, Crazy Mart in Baltimore, is also a winner. The business will collect a $500 Lottery bonus for selling a top-prize winning scratch-off worth $50,000.\nThe fifth edition of the Gold Bar Bingo game went on sale in July 2024. It began with eight $50,000 top prizes and there are still three of them remaining along with six $10,000 prizes and others ranging from $5 to $5,000.",
