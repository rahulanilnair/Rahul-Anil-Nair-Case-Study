    "text": "The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released its global passenger demand figures for November 2024, marking an all-time high of 83.4 percent in terms of load factor.\nTotal demand in terms of revenue passenger kilometres (RPK), was up 8.1 percent compared to November 2023.\nLikewise, total capacity in available seat kilometres (ASK) was up 5.7 percent year-on-year.\nThe November load factor was 83.4 percent, up 1.9 percentage points compared to November 2023, an all-time high for November.\nInternational demand was up 11.6 percent compared to November 2023, while capacity was up 8.6 percent year-on-year, and the load factor was 83.4 percent.\nStrong performance by carriers in Europe and Asia-Pacific drove this double-digit expansion in demand.\nOn the other hand, domestic demand rose by 3.1 percent compared to November 2023, while capacity was up 1.5 percent year-on-year and the load factor was 83.5 percent.\nA month of strong growth IATA director-general Willie Walsh remarked that November was another month of strong growth in the demand for air travel with an overall expansion of 8.1 percent.\nWalsh said: “The month was also another reminder of the supply chain issues that are preventing airlines from getting the aircraft they need to meet growing demand. Capacity growth is lagging demand by 2.4 ppts and load factors are at record levels. Airlines are missing out on opportunities to better serve customers, modernize their products and improve their environmental performance because aircraft are not being delivered on time.”\nHe added that, for 2025, the aerospace manufacturing sector should resolve to find a fast and durable solution for their supply chain issues.\nGrowth in regional markets All regions showed growth for international passenger markets in November 2024 compared to November 2023.\nEurope had the highest load factors at 85 percent, while Asia-Pacific led on growth with a 19.9 percent year-on-year expansion in demand.\nAsia-Pacific airlines achieved a 19.9 percent year-on-year increase in demand, and capacity increased 16.2 percent year-on-year and the load factor was 84.9 percent.\nEuropean carriers had a 9.4 percent year-on-year increase in demand; capacity increased by 7.1 percent year-on-year, and the load factor was 85 percent.\nMiddle Eastern carriers saw an 8.7 percent year-on-year increase in demand, while capacity increased 3.9 percent year-on-year and the load factor was 81 percent.\nNorth American carriers saw a 3.1 percent year-on-year increase in demand, capacity increased by 1.6 percent year-on-year, and the load factor at 81 percent.\nLatin American airlines saw an 11.4 percent year-on-year increase in demand, with capacity up by 11.9 percent year-on-year and load factor at 84.4 percent.\nAfrican airlines saw a 12.4 percent year-on-year increase in demand, while capacity was up 6 percent year-on-year and the load factor rose to 72.9 percent.\nOn the domestic front Domestic RPK was up 3.1 percent over the previous year, decelerating slightly from the 3.5 percent growth posted in October.\nSigns of stable growth were shown in all markets except in the US which saw a 2.7 percent contraction, deeper than the 1.2 percent year-on-year dip recorded in October.\nThis is part of a slowing trend in the US domestic market since June 2024 and mainly reflects lower low-cost carrier activity. US mainline carriers have continued to see growth over the same period.",
