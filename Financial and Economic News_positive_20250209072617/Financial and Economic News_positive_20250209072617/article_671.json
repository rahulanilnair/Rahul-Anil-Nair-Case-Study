    "text": "MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's record-breaking capital-raising spree will continue in 2025 given the strong pipeline of firms looking to go public, the head of the country's oldest exchange told Reuters.\n\"There are 90-plus companies that have already filed their draft prospectus with the regulator, looking to raise an estimated 1 trillion rupees ($11.65 billion) at some point this year,\" Sundararaman Ramamurthy, the CEO of BSE said on Thursday.\nLast year, 91 large firms went public on the BSE, earlier known as the Bombay Stock Exchange, and the NSE, or National Stock Exchange, raising a record 1.6 trillion rupees via initial public offerings (IPOs), according to analytics firm Prime Database.\nOverall public equity fundraising more than doubled to 3.73 trillion rupees.\nRamamurthy said the IPO boom has more Offers for Sale (OFS), where large shareholders sell existing shares, with the proceeds going to them, instead of fresh issues that provide firms with capital to invest.\n\"I would like to see the OFS percentage coming down and fresh capital raising go up.\"\nBSE earned 1.57 billion rupees in listing fees in the first-half of 2024-25, according to East India Securities. This compares to 1.3 billion rupees in fees reported a year earlier.\nRamamurthy declined to comment on BSE's financials ahead of its upcoming quarterly earnings.\nThe gains from the IPO pipeline, however, are being tempered by tighter rules for trading derivatives.\nThe notional value of derivatives traded in India has declined 40% since September, in anticipation of the new rules, while premiums have fallen 15%-20%, Ramamurthy said.\nA further decline could be expected since three of the six new rules introduced by the markets regulator will be implemented by April.\n\"We have to wait till April to judge the final impact,\" Ramamurthy said.\nBSE's shares have doubled since Nov. 20 when the rules were implemented as analysts expect a lower impact on the exchange compared to the NSE, which has larger derivative trading volumes.\nDIVERSIFYING REVENUE STREAMS\nBSE, which earns a major chunk of revenue from transaction charges and services to firms including listings, is looking to diversify its income streams, Ramamurthy said.\nIt aims to grow its index business, which licences indexes used by funds to benchmark investments.\n\"We have launched 15 indices since the middle of last year and there is room to continue working on that front,\" he said.\nIt is also considering expanding its co-location services, which are in demand as high-frequency and algorithmic trading increase.\n\"There is good possibility of generating revenue (in co-location), but we have not made a decision yet. We will look at it after April once market volumes settle down.\"\n($1 = 85.8380 Indian rupees)\n(Reporting by Ira Dugal, additional reporting by Bharath Rajeswaran; Editing by Sonia Cheema)\nBy Ira Dugal\nShare Â© Reuters - 2025",
