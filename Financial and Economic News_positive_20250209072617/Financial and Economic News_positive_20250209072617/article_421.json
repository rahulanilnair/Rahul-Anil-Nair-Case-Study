    "text": "By Christopher Boyll ,\n4 hours ago\nGREENE COUNTY, Ind. (WTWO/WAWV)— The Greene County Foundation received nearly $5 million to help with programs in its community.\nThe $4,999,486 comes from the Lilly Endowment. The Greene County Foundation plans to use the money to help increase childcare options for kids from babies up to the age of 3. The director of the foundation said they did a survey throughout the county of families and businesses and discovered there was a real lack of quality child care in the area.\n“We hope to create a difference in our communities with this grant it’s just going to give us some time to make it happen but we have every intention of making this a wonderful thing for our county and hopefully bring some folks back,” said Suzanne Jackson, Director of the Greene County Foundation.\nThe foundation also hopes to work with all of the school districts in Greene County.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
