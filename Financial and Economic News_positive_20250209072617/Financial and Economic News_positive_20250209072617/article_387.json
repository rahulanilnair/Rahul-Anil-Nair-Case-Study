    "text": "Driven to a large extent by the region’s enormous sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), the Middle East has become a new global hub of wealth and investment. This is especially the case in the six member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) — The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman — and the region’s six largest SWFs by assets under management (AUM), listed below in alphabetical order:\nA glance at recent trends presents a clear picture. By the third quarter of 2024, M&A aggregate deal value in the Middle East increased by 25.3% compared to the same period in 2023, primarily in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Moreover, in the first half of 2024, over 54% of funds deployed by SWFs globally were from major Middle East SWFs, the highest level since 2009. This is from a pool of $4 trillion, currently managed by just the six SWFs listed above, three of which are based in Abu Dhabi. As of October 2024, at $1.7 trillion, Abu Dhabi was the world’s richest city in terms of assets managed by SWFs.\nThe UAE, and Abu Dhabi in particular, is increasingly becoming a focal point internationally, building on an already established position as a regional hub. Factors for its rise in prominence include:\nSaudi Arabia is also expanding its position as a hub for business, with a number of leading international companies choosing to base their regional headquarters there. Its stock exchange continues to perform well, with deal volumes of IPOs, takeovers and capital raisings jumping by 85% through late 2024 and market capitalization reaching nearly $3 trillion, according to the financial services firm ION Analytics.\nThe substantial capital that SWFs in the GCC possess is forecast to double to $8 trillion by 2030. SWFs regularly feature in big-ticket, cross-border M&A transactions, and they are often sought after as co-investment partners and limited partner investors.\nRecent major transactions abroad include:\nMubadala emerged as the largest investor in 2024, investing $29.2 billion across 52 different deals. Alongside Mubadala, four other GCC funds — ADIA, ADQ, PIF and QIA ranked among the top 10 global dealmakers — investing a record $82 billion in 2024. Collectively, this shift away from passive minority investing and the capacity to lead investments and take controlling stakes bodes well for deal activity in 2025, according to ION Analytics’ analysis.\nAt the same time that the SWFs are taking a more active role in outbound investments, it has become easier to do business in the region. The GCC countries are increasingly open to foreign direct investment (FDI), relaxing restrictive local partnership requirements and streamlining regulatory processes.\nFor example, Saudi Arabia’s new investment law consolidates local and foreign firms under a single investment rule book, leveling the playing field.\nSignificant recent inbound deals include:\nThe introduction of “golden visas” allowing for long-term residencies should help attract foreign talent. Revised rules of property ownership and inheritance that are more beneficial for foreigners and low taxes are also likely to make the region appealing to skilled foreigners who can help sustain and expand the region’s role in global finance.\nFurther, with energy transition and diversification a key focus regionally, a more permissive FDI regime led to investments worth approximately $47 billion into the GCC in 2023 alone, with foreign capital investments in Saudi Arabia accounting for 62% of the total value. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is also aiming to more than triple FDI, from $29 billion in 2023 to $100 billion a year by 2030.\nSuch goals have also featured heavily in governments’ ambitious national programs for energy transition, with clean energy investment accounting for 15% of total investment in the sector.\nAnother source of attracting foreign investment is the GCC funds’ prioritization of investments in cutting-edge industries such as AI and cryptocurrencies, as in part illustrated by Microsoft’s investment in the UAE’s G42.\n[View source.]\nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations.
