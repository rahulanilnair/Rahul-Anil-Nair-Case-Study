New federal money will allow the higher speed railroad to add capacity for the region’s commuters. (Carline Jean/South Florida Sun Sentinel) By David Lyons | South Florida Sun Sentinel UPDATED: January 9, 2025 at 5:50 PM EST Brightline, which jarred customers by reducing capacity for South Florida rail commuters last year, will soon partially restore what it took away with the help of a $33.8 million grant from Washington, the company announced Thursday.\nThe higher speed regional rail line, which operates between Miami and Orlando, says the money from the Federal Railroad Administration will allow the company to speed up the addition of new coaches to its trainsets, which will each grow in length to seven cars from five by mid-year.\nAs part of a “Restoration and Enhancement grant” from the FRA, the rail line will also “reintroduce a new South Florida commuter pass designed for the frequent traveler.” The program is scheduled to launch in March and “is expected to save daily commuters money,” the company said in a statement released late Thursday. Details will be available on Brightline’s website and app.\n“The funding allows us to expedite new passenger cars into service and with that capacity, increased availability for the South Florida traveler,” Patrick Goddard, the company president, said in a staterment.\nIn South Florida, Brightline serves stations in downtown Miami, Aventura, Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton and West Palm Beach along the Florida East Coast Railway corridor.\nBrightline launched its Central Florida service in September 2023. But as it sought to build traffic between Miami and Orlando, it shifted some of its seating capacity from South Florida to emphasize its long-haul service. In doing so, Brightline canceled three popular pass programs last June, angering a number of riders who said they would likely return to their cars for inter-county travel in South Florida because it was too expensive to ride Brightline without discounted fares.\nNonetheless, overall system ridership has risen year over year according to the company’s monthly financial reports. But short-haul numbers have declined as a result of the capacity shift favoring Central Florida. Short-haul rdidership stood at 90,624 for November 2024 versus 112,423 in the same month of 2023, according to the November 2024 report.\nAn ‘interim’ plan for commuter rail Goddard characterized the new program as “a bridge or interim plan before Brightline and local counties are able to establish commuter lines in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.\n“We’ve been working on developing a true commuter system in South Florida for years, but that solution takes time and can’t be turned on overnight,” Goddard said. “This is the next best thing and can be seen as an interim commuter program before Miami-Dade and Broward launch service.”\nAs Brightline has built out its higher speed intercity regional service, it has been working with both Miami-Dade and Broward counties to create a separate dedicated rail line for local commuters that would run along the FEC corridor.\nThus far, planners envision the line starting at Brightline’s downtown Miami Central station, and proceeding north to stations to be built at several points in Miami-Dade, across the county line into Broward where there would be stops at Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, and a site to be determined near the Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale.\nEach county would be responsible for paying annual access fees to Brightline. Discussions aimed at reaching final user agreements with each county “are ongoing,” Goddard said.\nTri-Rail, the publicly funded commuter line serving Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties along a state-owned rail corridor that parallels Interstate 95, has been frequently mentioned as the potential operator.\nOriginally Published: January 9, 2025 at 5:02 PM EST Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window) Most Popular Most Popular Driver of Delray Beach fire truck in Brightline train crash confirmed Driver of Delray Beach fire truck in Brightline train crash confirmed Broward principal arrested, accused of impersonating law enforcement officer Broward principal arrested, accused of impersonating law enforcement officer New Margate Publix will include second-floor outdoor seating area for eating Pub subs and more New Margate Publix will include second-floor outdoor seating area for eating Pub subs and more Florida sues Miramar company to recover $5.8 million COVID overpayment.
