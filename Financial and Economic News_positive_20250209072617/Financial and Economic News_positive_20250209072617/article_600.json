    "text": "(Reuters) - Shares of India's top software services exporter Tata Consultancy Services jumped 4% in pre-open trade on Friday, as investors cheered its assessment that there are early signs of a demand revival.\nTCS CEO K Krithivasan told reporters in a post-earnings press conference on Thursday that the company was seeing more confidence in discretionary programmes in the coming years.\nKritivasan's comments overshadowed a weak performance in North American revenue for the fifth straight quarter.\n(Reporting by Nandan Mandayam in Bengaluru; Editing by Varun H K)\nShare Â© Reuters - 2025",
