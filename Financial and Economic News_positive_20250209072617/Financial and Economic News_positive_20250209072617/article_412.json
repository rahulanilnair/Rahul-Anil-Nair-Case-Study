    "text": "According to new legislation, two models of the Toyota Corolla hybrid received full exemption from IPVA in the State of São Paulo in this year of 2025\nO Toyota Corolla Altis Hybrid and Corolla Cross Hybrid are the only hybrid vehicles that received full exemption from IPVA in 2025, in accordance with the new legislation of the State of São Paulo. [The measure is part of a government strategy to encourage local production](https://en.clickpetroleoegas.com.br/Denmark-opens-its-doors-to-butchers-Europe%27s-largest-meatpacking-plant-hires-professionals-with-salaries-exceeding-%E2%82%AC3-per-month/) and the use of sustainable technologies, according to the Garagem 360 website.\nUnderstand the law that benefited the Toyota Corolla hybrid\nIPVA exemption for flex hybrid models was established by State Law No. 18.065, of December 18, 2024. According to article 5 of this law, vehicles eligible for exemption must have the following characteristics:\n- Hybrid Flex Technology: Combination of flex combustion engine (ethanol and gasoline or ethanol only) with electric motor.\n- Price: Vehicle value up to BRL 250.000,00.\n- Modules: Minimum 40 kW (54 hp) of electrical power.\n- Electrical system: Powered by a minimum voltage system of 150 V, with energy recovery for the batteries.\nToyota Corolla models, manufactured in Sorocaba, in the interior of São Paulo, meet all these requirements, guaranteeing their exemption.\n-\n[Automotive revolution: Mitsubishi XForce HEV gains hybrid power and is ready to land in this country in March 2025](https://en.clickpetroleoegas.com.br/automotive-revolution-mitsubishi-xforce-hev-gains-hybrid-power-and-is-ready-to-land-in-this-country-in-march-2025/) -\n[Fiat Uno Diesel?

[This is due to the inferior technical specifications.](https://en.clickpetroleoegas.com.br/with-a-salary-of-R%245-and-a-monthly-workload-of-052-hours%2C-SESI-opens-a-selection-process-with-several-benefits/), such as less powerful electric motors and lower voltage electrical systems.\nIn addition to Fiat, mild hybrid vehicles from other brands such as Kia, Caoa Chery and others were also left out of the exemption, not meeting the minimum requirements established by the new law.\nGovernment justification for IPVA exemption\nThe governor of São Paulo, Tarcísio de Freitas, explained that The law was designed to strengthen the local automobile industry. According to him, the measure aims to attract and prioritize the production of hybrid vehicles in the state of São Paulo, with brands such as GM, GWM, Toyota and Volkswagen already confirming local production plans.\nFreitas [emphasized that the benefit will only be intended for vehicles produced in the state](https://en.clickpetroleoegas.com.br/with-a-salary-of-R%245-and-a-monthly-workload-of-052-hours%2C-SESI-opens-a-selection-process-with-several-benefits/), excluding those manufactured in other regions or abroad. This decision explicitly excludes vehicles such as those from BYD, which have production units in Bahia.",
