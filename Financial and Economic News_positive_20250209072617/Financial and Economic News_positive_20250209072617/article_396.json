Our project development involves site specific environmental assessments that include cultural surveys, threatened and endangered species assessments, wetlands delineations, as well as consultation with wildlife regulatory agencies. Another important aspect of our development process is Lightsource bp’s commitment to engaging with local stakeholders within the community.\nInformation and resources\nWe’ve put together a collection of resources for anyone who’d like to know more about our Birch solar project – or about solar in general.\nSolar farm FAQs\nWe’ve put together a list of the most commonly asked questions, and their answers.\nResponsible Solar Stories\nFind out more about our Responsible Solar approach\nRecycling and lifecycle management of solar panels\nOur commitment to recycling solar panels\nGet in touch\nIf you’d like to find out more about this project, email [uscommunityrelations@lightsourcebp.com](mailto:uscommunityrelations@lightsourcebp.com), or fill out the form, in the link below.
