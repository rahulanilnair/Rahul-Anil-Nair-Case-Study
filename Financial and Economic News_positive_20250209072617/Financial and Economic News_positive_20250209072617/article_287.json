    "text": "{p}By now you've probably heard about Governor Kathy Hochul's plan to send an inflation refund check to most New York taxpayers next year.{/p}{p}It's the first proposal to come from her 2025 State of the State address -- 3 billion dollars’ worth of checks will be sent out. 300 dollars to individual taxpayers making less 150-thousand dollars, 500 bucks for joint filers making less than 300-thousand.{/p}{p}Where will all that money come from? The Governor says it will come from excess sales tax revenue that has spiked because of inflation.{/p}{p}Not everyone is buying that -- there are questions from both sides of the aisle.{/p}{p}Democratic Senator Pat Fahy of Albany says “I'm not convinced just yet on the $3 billion with the rebate.{/p}{p}I'm wondering if there are other ways I've got to really wait to see the details on some of it, but I appreciate that the Governor is very focused on the issue.”{/p}{p}On the Republican side Senator Pam Helming of Canandaigua says “We have some of the highest taxes in the nation. So while there’s a one-time rebate check that may sound nice to people, it’s doing nothing long term to lower the cost of living.”{/p}{p}If the proposal goes through, about half a million people in the Capital Region would receive a check next year.",
