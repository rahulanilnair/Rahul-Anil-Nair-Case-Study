    "text": "The Laken Riley Act, a key immigration enforcement bill,\n[overcame](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/laken-riley-act-overcomes-filibuster-senate-dems-give-gop-helping-hand) the Senate filibuster during a procedural vote on Thursday, garnering the 60 votes needed to move it toward a final vote.\nThe legislation was introduced at the beginning of the new Congress by Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., and Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga.\nBREAKING: 9 Democrats just voted against advancing the Laken Riley Act which would require law enforcement to detain illegals who commit theft-related crimes.\nCorey Booker\nMazie Hirono\nAndy Kim\nElizabeth Warren\nEd Markey\nJeff Merkley\nBernie Sanders\nTina Smith\nBrian Schatz\nWhy…\n[pic.twitter.com/HDWHMAyFIG]\n— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok)\n[January 9, 2025] [Celebrate Trump's Historic 2024 Victory with the Exclusive Trump 47th President Collection!](https://proudpatriots.com/collections/47th-president-collection?utm_source=affiliatetraffic&oid=185&_ef_transaction_id=&affid=415&oid=185&affid=415&source_id=txtad)\nIt represents a significant push to strengthen immigration enforcement measures following a tragic incident that highlighted the consequences of illegal immigration.\n“Today’s vote on the Laken Riley Act is an important step forward in making our country safer, but there’s still more work to be done to get this commonsense legislation across the finish line,” Sen. Britt said in a statement following the vote.\n“Laken’s horrific murder should never have happened. While we cannot bring Laken back, Congress can and must pass the Laken Riley Act to save American lives and prevent this tragedy from repeating itself. Congress has an obligation to Laken, her family, and to Americans in every corner of our country to get this bill passed and signed into law.”\n🚨WATCH LIVE 📺\nI’m leading a press conference with Senate Republican leaders following our vote to advance the Laken Riley Act—important legislation to make America safer.\n[https://t.co/fgIL3HhhuJ]\n— Senator Katie Boyd Britt (@SenKatieBritt)\n[January 9, 2025]\nThe bill is named in honor of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student from Augusta University who was murdered on the University of Georgia’s campus in February.\nJose Ibarra, a 26-year-old illegal immigrant, was found guilty of multiple charges, including felony murder, and was sentenced to life in prison without parole in November.\nThe Laken Riley Act would require Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to arrest and detain illegal immigrants convicted of theft, burglary, or shoplifting until they are deported.\nAdditionally, the bill would give states the ability to file civil lawsuits against federal officials who fail to enforce immigration laws.\nThe legislation received a boost from Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who prioritized it as the first major vote in the Senate.\nWhile all Senate Republicans supported the measure, it was initially uncertain whether enough Democrats would join to surpass the 60-vote threshold required to defeat the filibuster.\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., was the first Democrat to announce his support, helping to build momentum for the bill.\nMORE NEWS:\n[Adam Carolla: California Wildfires and ‘9 Angry Lesbians’ Are Gonna Red-Pill Victims [WATCH]](https://www.rvmnews.com/2025/01/adam-carolla-california-wildfires-and-9-angry-lesbians-are-gonna-red-pill-victims-watch/?utm_source=in-article-related-3)\nHe and Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., both became co-sponsors, which prompted further Democratic support.\nBy Thursday morning, at least 13 Senate Democrats had committed to advancing the legislation. Among them were Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., Gary Peters, D-Mich., John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., Angus King, I-Maine, Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Fetterman.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also voted in favor of advancing the bill, citing the opportunity to debate and propose amendments.\nSchumer stated on the Senate floor, “I believe there are enough votes for this measure to beat the filibuster.”\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., indicated that he would likely support advancing the legislation, further solidifying bipartisan backing.\nWhile the cloture vote required 60 votes, the final vote on the bill will only need a simple majority to pass, which appears likely given the broad bipartisan support during the procedural vote.\nIf passed, the Laken Riley Act will head to President-elect Trump’s desk, ensuring it becomes law.\nMORE NEWS:\n[Dem Mayor Arrested in Major Trafficking Bust: Drugs, Illegal Guns, and Prostitution [WATCH]](https://www.rvmnews.com/2025/01/dem-mayor-arrested-in-major-trafficking-bust-drugs-illegal-guns-and-prostitution-watch/?utm_source=in-article-related-4)\nSeveral of the Democrats who helped the bill advance face re-election in 2026 in competitive states, including Sens. Ossoff, Shaheen, Peters, and Hickenlooper, potentially influencing their decision to support the measure.\nThe success of the Laken Riley Act reflects a shift toward bipartisan cooperation on immigration enforcement and underscores the urgency of addressing issues that impact public safety and national security.\nJoin the Discussion\nCOMMENTS POLICY: We have no tolerance for messages of violence, racism, vulgarity, obscenity or other such discourteous behavior.
