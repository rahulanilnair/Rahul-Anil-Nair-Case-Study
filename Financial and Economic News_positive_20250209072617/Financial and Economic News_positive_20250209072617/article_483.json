    "text": "10th January 2025\nChairman of the Edo State Internal Revenue Service (EIRS), Oladele Bankole-Balogun\nBy Zika Bobby The Chairman of the Edo State Internal Revenue Service (EIRS), Oladele Bankole-Balogun, has expressed his determination to revolutionise revenue collection in Edo State, targeting a monthly revenue of over N10 billion in the short term. Speaking about his plans, Bankole-Balogun said records from the previous administration indicate an average monthly revenue of N6.4 billion, with a peak of N7.8 billion recorded in January 2024, stressing that he is confident that implementing new reforms will significantly enhance the state’s revenue generation. To achieve this, the chairman said: “We are committed to cleaning up the system, blocking loopholes and phasing out manual revenue collection. It’s time to modernise our processes.” Related News Nigeria’s infrastructure deficiencies could lead to billions in lost productivity –SBM Intelligence Experts, stakeholders chart new course for Nigeria’s oil, gas industry Stockbrokers’ Institute appoints Adeonipekun Registrar/Chief Executive He said that the practice of using tax officers armed with canes to chase citizens for tax payments is outdated and will be abolished. Bankole-Balogun said he has received the blessing of Governor Monday Okpebholo, to introduce cutting-edge technologies designed to streamline revenue collection, eliminate inefficiencies and maximize the state’s income. His words: “We aim to double what the state currently generates. There’s nothing stopping us from achieving N12 billion monthly in the long run, but my immediate target is N10 billion after implementing all the reforms we are about to introduce.” He added: “Governor Monday Okpebholo has a bold vision for the state and he is set to usher in a new era of efficient revenue collection, ensuring increased resources for Edo State’s development.”",
