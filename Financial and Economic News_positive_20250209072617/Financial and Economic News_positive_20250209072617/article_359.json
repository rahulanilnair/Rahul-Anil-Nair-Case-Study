    "text": "The Federal Government has proposed a 53 per cent increase in the 2025 budget allocations for military retirees following a series of protests over unpaid entitlements.\nFindings by The PUNCH showed that the total allocation for military pensions is set to rise from N221.66bn in 2024 to N338.90bn in 2025, reflecting an effort to address the demands of retired service personnel who have repeatedly demonstrated at the Ministry of Finance in Abuja.\nAccording to data from the proposed 2025 budget, allocations for military pensions will increase significantly.\nThe breakdown shows N230.32bn for military pensions, N66.85bn for expected retirees this year, and N38.15bn for death benefits, with an unchanged allocation of N3.57bn for the National Health Insurance Scheme for military retirees.\nIn comparison, the 2024 budget allocated N166.53bn for military pensions, N29.49bn for expected retirees, N22.07bn for death benefits, and N3.57bn for NHIS.\nThis increase follows protests by retired military personnel under the Coalition of Military Pensioners.\nThe retirees barricaded the Ministry of Finance at least twice in two months, demanding the payment of outstanding entitlements.\nTheir grievances include the non-payment of a 20 to 28 per cent salary increment for the period from January to November 2024, palliatives for October 2023 to November 2024, and a bulk payment of the Security Debarment Allowance.\nThey also want a refund of pension deductions from the salaries of medically boarded soldiers, and an additional N32,000 added to their pensions.\nOn December 5, 2024, the pensioners staged a protest at the ministry, effectively shutting down operations by erecting canopies and chairs at the entrance.\nDespite assurances from government officials, the pensioners claim their demands have not been met in full.\nSpeaking to The PUNCH earlier, a veteran leader, Chief Aliyu Umar, stated that the government had failed to honour its commitment.\n“Do you remember our protest last time? We were promised 50 per cent payment that day and the balance by month’s end. True to the minister’s words, we received the 50 per cent, but since then, nothing more.\n“All our efforts to reach the ministry have been futile. We have mobilised across the country and will lock down the Ministry of Finance as we did last time,” he said.\nIn response to the December protests, the Federal Government paid 50 per cent of the owed entitlements and promised to settle the balance later.\nHowever, the failure to fulfill this promise led to another protest on January 7, 2025, when the retirees again barricaded the Ministry of Finance, preventing staff from accessing the premises.\nFollowing the January protest, the Federal Government began paying retired military personnel their long overdue entitlements.\nThe ex-miliary men, who converged on the Ministry of Finance headquarters in Abuja on Tuesday, started receiving payment alerts from the protest ground.\nShortly before the protesters began receiving their alerts, the Chairman of the Military Pension Board, Air Vice Marshal Paul Irumheson, addressed the retirees, confirming that the funds for their entitlements had been transferred to the board.\nHe said, “We have received the money for the payment of your entitlements, and in the next few minutes, you will start seeing your alerts. We plead with you to leave as we are making efforts to ensure everyone gets paid.”\nThe spokesperson for the Coalition for Concerned Veterans, Abiodun Durowaiye-Herberts, confirmed that alerts had started coming through.\n“Our people have started receiving the alerts. We are now evacuating the ministry headquarters to return to our various homes,” he said.\nAnother leader of the veteran community, Chief Aliyu Umar, also confirmed the development to our correspondent, expressing frustration at the government’s earlier claims.\nHe said, “Yes, we have started receiving our money. They said there was no money—so where did this come from? Do we always have to protest before we are given our entitlements?”\nThe recurring protests have drawn public attention to the plight of military retirees, many of whom have served the nation with distinction but now face financial hardships due to delays in receiving their entitlements.\nThe retirees’ grievances have also raised concerns about the transparency and efficiency of the Military Pensions Board.\nIn December 2023, the Senate announced plans to investigate the Military Pensions Board over allegations of financial mismanagement.\nThe Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriation, Olamilekan Adeola, made the announcement during the defence of the budget report by the Senate Committee on Establishment and Public Service.\nDuring the session, an additional fund amounting to N20bn was requested for the construction of an office building for the military pensions board, as well as the renovation of phases 1 to 4 of the federal secretariat.\nThe chairman questioned the operations of the board, its budget, and the number of retirees who reportedly receive payment.\nThe proposed increase in the 2025 budget, which is likely due to the minimum wage adjustment, is seen as a positive step towards addressing these concerns.\nThe PUNCH earlier reported that following the consequential adjustment in salary structures by the committee set up by the government to review the new minimum wage, retirees would receive an increment of N32,000 in their monthly pensions.\nWhile the increased allocations signal the government’s willingness to address the grievances of military retirees, the critical challenge lies in the effective and timely implementation of these commitments.\nEarlier in November last year, retirees from Nigeria’s Contributory Pension Scheme staged a protest at the Federal Ministry of Finance in Abuja.\nThe retirees, angered by the delay in the payment of their pension arrears, blocked the main entrance of the ministry’s secretariat, demanding an audience with the minister.\nAddressing the protesting retirees in November, the Federal Government promised to pay the outstanding pension arrears as it released only about 25 per cent of the total amount budgeted for 2024.\nThe Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, disclosed that of the N88bn budgeted for pension arrears in 2024, N22bn had already been disbursed.\nHe assured the retirees that the remaining funds would be paid by the end of the year.\nFor a sustainable solution, Edun revealed that the FG is considering raising funds through the capital market to clear the backlog.\nThe PUNCH observed that in the 2025 proposed budget, N20.99bn was budgeted for pension increment arrears (Jan – Dec 2024), N221.54bn for pension protection fund, N387.54bn for arrears of 33 per cent increase in pension rates and N30.79bn for civilian pensions.",
