    "text": "Stock market today: Equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty recorded losses for the third straight session on Friday, aligning with global market weakness as worries about economic growth and declining quarterly earnings dampened investment sentiment. The market downturn was further influenced by rising crude oil prices and a stronger dollar index.The BSE Sensex experienced volatile trading, falling 241.30 points or 0.31 per cent to close at 77,378.91. The index fluctuated 820.15 points during the day, reaching a high of 77,919.70 and a low of 77,099.55.The NSE Nifty declined by 95 points or 0.40 per cent to 23,431.50.Among the 30 blue-chip companies, major decliners included IndusInd Bank, NTPC, UltraTech Cement, Sun Pharma, Axis Bank, State Bank of India, Tata Steel, Power Grid, Adani Ports and Kotak Mahindra Bank.Tata Consultancy Services saw a significant rise of nearly 6 per cent following its announcement of an 11.95 per cent increase in December quarter net profit to Rs 12,380 crore.Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech, Infosys and Bajaj Finserv emerged as other notable gainers.Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 7,170.87 crore on Thursday, as per exchange data.\\\"Domestic market sentiment remained subdued due to rising crude oil prices, driven by supply concerns, and a strengthening dollar index. Despite the IT sector's resilience following positive early Q3 results, broader indices bled due to uncertainties surrounding Trump policies and high valuations.\\\"Consolidation may persist in the near term, yet investors are closely watching the US non-farm payroll data today for further guidance,\\\" Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said.Asian markets in Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai and Hong Kong ended lower.European markets traded in negative territory. US markets remained closed on Thursday.Global oil benchmark Brent crude increased 2.02 per cent to USD 78.47 a barrel.In the previous trading session, the BSE benchmark fell 528.28 points or 0.68 per cent, closing below 78,000 at 77,620.21. The Nifty decreased by 162.45 points or 0.69 per cent to 23,526.50.",
