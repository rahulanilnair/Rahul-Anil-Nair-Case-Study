    "text": "French operator Free has reaffirmed its commitment to not increasing its prices of its primary two mobile plans until 2027. On the occasion of its 10th anniversary in 2022, Free committed to not increasing the prices of the 2â‚¬ Plan and Free Plan. Three years later, the promise kept and Free is today reiterating this unprecedented commitment.\nFree is the only operator to have made such a commitment, despite the inflationary context and the heavy investments made to deploy 5G in all territories. With coverage of nearly 95% of the population in 5G by the end of 2024, Free still has the largest 5G network in France in terms of number of sites.\nNicolas Thomas, CEO, Free\nThis commitment is both courageous and unprecedented and is more in line with our strategy than ever. Fixed prices, simplicity, and generosity: true to our values, we continue to innovate to remain a real anti-inflation weapon and protect consumers' purchasing power!",
