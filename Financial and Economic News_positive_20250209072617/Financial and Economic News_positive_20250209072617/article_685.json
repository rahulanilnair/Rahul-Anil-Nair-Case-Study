There was $2 billion in additional packages of support to Ukraine,” he said in a video posted on the television channel’s Telegram account.\nThe aid covered air defence, information technology, demining, naval forces, air forces and artillery.\n“And all this will strengthen Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said.\nThe president gave no details on which countries had made the pledges.\nZelensky says Western troops in Ukraine would help ‘force Russia to peace’\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had earlier said that Washington would provide Ukraine with an additional $500 million in military aid, including air defence missiles, air-to-ground munitions and support equipment for F-16 fighter jets.\nZelenskiy attended the meeting at Ramstein and then met Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome, where he said he discussed upgrading Ukraine’s air defences against Russian attacks and efforts to form a united position on moving forward to a resolution of the war.\nGermany Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy Antony Blinken RUssia Ukraine war F 16 fighter jets US aid Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni Comments 200 characters Print\nSBP governor seems very optimistic about economy",
