    "text": "Summary\n- Pokemon TCG Pocket has generated over $400 million in revenue within just two months of release.\n- The game maintained steady player spending through events like Fire Pokemon Mass Outbreak and Mythical Island.\n- Expect future expansions and updates as The Pokemon Company and DeNA continue to support Pokemon TCG Pocket.\nPokemon TCG Pocket has earned over $400 million, which bodes well for a game that's been out for such a short time. There was plenty of excitement building for [Pokemon TCG Pocket](https://gamerant.com/db/video-game/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket/)'s attempt to make the classic Pokemon Trading Card Game even more approachable through its mobile-app spin-off. It appears that much of that excitement has translated into sales and that Pokemon TCG Pocket may be here to stay for the foreseeable future.\nIt's been clear that [Pokemon TCG Pocket was a hit from the beginning](http://gamerant.com/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-launch-success/). In its first 48 hours online, the game was downloaded over 10 million times. Although it's typical for titles like these to receive plenty of attention from curious gamers at the start, it's just as important for them to retain players and accrue revenue, ensuring that the investment in the project was worth it. So far, The Pokemon Company's newest foray into the mobile gaming space appears to be a home run.\n[Related\n](/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-event-task-completion-issue-bug/)\n[\nPokemon TCG Pocket Players Discover Major Issue with Wonder Pick Event\n](/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-event-task-completion-issue-bug/)\nSome Pokemon TCG Pocket players take to social media to report an annoying issue with the mobile game's ongoing Wonder Pick event.\nUsing stats from AppMagic, [Pocketgamer.biz's Aaron Astle estimates](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-smashes-400-million-in-10-weeks/) that Pokemon TCG Pocket has already made over $400 million in gross revenue. This is an impressive milestone in general, but the amount of revenue generated by the game becomes more of a marvel after considering that it's barely been two months [since Pokemon TCG Pocket released](http://gamerant.com/pokemon-tgc-pocket-total-sales-november-2024/). Although 2024 was a slower year for Pokemon game releases compared to their usual schedule, this outing from DeNA and The Pokemon Company seems to be helping keep the hype going anyway.\nPokemon TCG Pocket Clears Another Impressive Milestone\nBy the end of its first month, Pokemon TCG Pocket rocketed past $200 million in sales, and over the course of the approximately 10 weeks the game has been available, player spending has continued at a steady rate, hitting its first peak around its limited-time Fire Pokemon Mass Outbreak event. The game saw another surge in spending during its eighth week when [the Pokemon TCG Pocket Mythical Island expansion launched](https://gamerant.com/ptcgp-pokemon-pocket-mythical-island-expansion-miniset-a1a-list-cards/). Although players appear comfortable spending their money on Pokemon TCG Pocket regardless, events like these that come with limited card sets are likely to encourage the habit, ensuring that business for Pokemon TCG Pocket is thriving.\nWith so much going for Pokemon TCG Pocket so soon after its launch, The Pokemon Company likely has plenty more in store for the game in the vein of expansions and updates. With the February Pokemon Presents date on the horizon, any big new announcements in the vein of [more Pokemon TCG Pocket expansions and quality-of-life updates](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-community-showcase-feature-change-good-why/) will probably be saved for next month. It's easy to anticipate that DeNA and The Pokemon Company will support Pokemon TCG Pocket for a long time, given it continues to make impressive figures like these.",
