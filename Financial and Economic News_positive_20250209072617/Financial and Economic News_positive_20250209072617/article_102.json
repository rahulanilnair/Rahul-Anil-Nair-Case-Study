    "text": "45\nTo cope with an unexpected event that damages the national economy, more and more Peruvians are choosing to draw up a financial plan for 2025.\n“With the instability and insecurity that exists in the country, the best position we need to adopt is prevention. For this reason it becomes increasingly important to have a savings plan and choose financial products that help us recover our money or working capital, in the event that an accident, an attack or a natural disaster occurs”, said Eduardo Morón , president of the Peruvian Association of Insurance Companies (APESEG).\nTo develop a personal or family financial plan, APESEG recommends the following steps:\nBalance. Evaluate the previous year’s performance and identify which expenses were the strongest. Analyses. Define your main sources of monthly income. Includes fixed wages and temporary income. Invoices. Make a list of major personal and family expenses, including utilities, food, transportation, among others. Goals. Set clear personal and family goals, such as studies, travel, major purchases and other investments. Savings method. Allocate 50% of your income to primary needs, 30% to distraction and 20% to savings. With this scheme you will be able to quickly obtain savings that will be useful for emergencies. Additionally, you may want to consider purchasing health insurance or insurance to protect your most valuable family assets such as your car or home.\n“About 60% of Peruvians over the age of 18 save within the financial system, which means that a large percentage of people cannot save or prefer to keep their money at home, exposing themselves to losing their capital in a assault or in a fire”, commented Eduardo Morón.\n“Once you have identified your income and expenses, you can take the next step and rely on the financial system to earn interest on savings accounts, fixed-term accounts or more profitable investment products such as savings life insurance, that also “They will help you enjoy a worry-free retirement,” he added.\n#steps #achieve #goals\n–",
