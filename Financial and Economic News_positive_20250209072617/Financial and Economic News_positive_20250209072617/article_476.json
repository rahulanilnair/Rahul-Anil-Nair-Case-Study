    "text": "A quick look at the performance of unit trusts in 2024 shows that no fewer than 26 unit trusts in SA achieved returns of more than 30%. More than 100 chalked up returns of more than 20% over 12 months.\nThe best-performing unit trust ended 2024 with an annual return of nearly 72%, the second best with 68% and the third with 54%, while 10 unit trusts spoilt investors with total returns of 40% and more.\nRead: JSE’s best and worst shares of 2024\nThe best of the bunch with the 72% return was the Raven BCI Worldwide Flexible Fund , according to the Profile Data published on Moneyweb.\nDownloading the fund’s fact sheet shows that this beautiful return was due to a big investment in the US tech giant Nvidia – which increased by close to 165% from $53 in January to $140 at the end of 2024.\nListen/read: Nvidia vs China tech: A $3.6trn giant in perspective\nThe fund did even better by investing in AppLovin Corporation, a tech company that facilitates the development and publishing of software applications.\nAppLovin gained a massive 741% from beginning January to end December 2024.\nThe Saltlight SNN Worldwide Flexible Fund can also thank AppLovin for its gain of 68% during 2024. It had an investment in Sea Limited, which produces online games and entertainment, which returned 187%.\nCloser to home, the Saltlight fund got a return of 114% by investing in WeBuyCars and 97% from its punt on Kar . Blue Label Telecomms, Brookfields Corporation and Roblox Corporation earned the fund close to 50% each.\nBrookfields is also an interesting investment. It claims to be the world’s biggest alternative investment manager.\nBest unit trusts of 2024\nFund Total return over 12 months Total return over 5 years Raven BCI Worldwide Flexible Fund (A) 71.76% 27.13% SaltLight SNN Worldwide Flexible Fund (C1) 68.32% Sygnia FAANG Plus Equity Fund (A) 53.70% 30.49% Momentum GF Global Sustainable Equity Feeder Fund (E) 49.59% Sygnia Itrix FANG.AI Actively Managed ETF () 47.89% RCI BCI Worldwide Flexible Growth Fund (L) 41.65% 15.20% Ninety One Value Fund (H) 41.34% 14.23% Momentum GF Global Equity Feeder Fund (A) 40.31% 1NVEST S&P 500 Info Tech Index Feeder ETF () 40.23% 30.49% Glacier Long Term Global Feeder Fund (B) 39.47% Sygnia 4th Industrial Revolution Global Equity Fund (A) 36.31% 15.47% Anchor BCI Global Equity Feeder Fund (A) 35.62% 19.23% Nedgroup Investments Entrepreneur Fund (R) 35.22% 13.06% Satrix Property ETF (A) 34.93% 3.09% 10X SA Property Index Fund (A) 34.67% Nedgroup Investments Entrepreneur Fund (A) 34.43% 12.46% Prescient Property Equity Fund (A2) 34.41% 5.03% PortfolioMetrix BCI SA Property Fund (A) 33.98% 7.61% Absa Property Equity Fund (A) 33.93% 8.03% M&G Property Fund (A) 33.55% 1NVEST Capped Property Index Tracker Fund (B3) 32.91% 3.01% BIP BCI Moderate Worldwide Flexible Fund (C) 32.58% 13.80% AF Investments Property Equity Fund (A) 32.40% 4.16% 1NVEST SA Property ETF 32.27% 4.78% Source: Profile Data published on Moneyweb\nFAANG fund\nUS technology shares were also behind the good performance of the next few unit trusts on the list.\nSygnia FAANG Plus Equity Fund obviously had Nvidia, and earned 71% from Meta Platforms, 47% from Amazon.com and 37% from Alphabet Incorporated.\nFAANG stocks also delivered for the Momentum GF Global Sustainable Equity Feeder Fund , while it had an investment in JP Morgan that returned 43%. Its investments in Novo Nordisk and Merck & Company unfortunately lost 14% and 16%, respectively.\nUS tech stocks also boosted the next two unit trusts on the list – another Sygnia fund based on FAANGs ( Sygnia Itrix AI Actively Managed ETF ) and the RCI BCI Worldwide Growth Fund .\nThe next one – the Ninety One Value Fund , which boasted a return of 41% – deserves a special prize.\nIts fund managers and analysts achieved this remarkable return by chasing value shares on the JSE.\nThe largest holdings in the portfolio include Absa, Life Healthcare Group, AECI, Italtile, Brait, Netcare, Pan African Resources, Datatec, Caxton & CTP Publishers and Printers, and Altron.\nThe losers\nThe list of the unit trusts that were the worst performers during 2024 does not need a lot of analysis.\nIt also needs to be said that the portfolio managers are not to blame for the bad performance.\nThe laggards include several funds that invest in commodities and resources, international bonds, and international property trusts. Their time will come.\nThe Montrose BCI Flexible Fund of Funds unit trust lost its investors nearly 9% due to its investments in funds that hold US and other bonds.\nThe Legacy Africa Regional Equity Prescient Fund had a horrid time investing in businesses that operate in Africa.\nThis fund’s objective is to invest in companies that generate more than 50% of their revenue on the African continent (excluding SA).\nAround 38% of the fund was invested in Egypt, 20% in Kenya and 10% in Morocco. Nearly 50% of the investments were in financial companies, but that the fund had nearly 20% in cash (June 2024) hints that there are not many opportunities in Africa.\nThe fund is also very small. The fact sheet dated end June 2024 disclosed that it only had assets of R32 million.\nThe PSG Global Equity Feeder Fund got it wrong too. Its biggest investments – in Prudential plc, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Shell, Glencore and Babcock International Group – did not perform well. As a result, investors were about 8% poorer than they were in January 2024.\nThe majority of the funds that performed badly included commodity funds, international property and international bond trusts.\nThe unit trusts that did not deliver\nFund Total return over 12 months Total return over 5 years Montrose BCI Flexible Fund of Funds (A) -8.1% 3.9% Legacy Africa Regional Equity Prescient Fund (A1) -7.9% PSG Global Equity Feeder Fund (A) -7.1% 12.5% Ninety One Commodity Fund (A) -6.4% 8.2% Fairtree Global Real Estate Prescient Feeder Fund (A1) -6.0% 2.4% Discovery Global Real Estate Securities Feeder Fund (A) -5.9% 2.1% Sanlam Resources Fund (A) -5.4% 11.1% Old Mutual Namibia Stable Growth Fund (A) -4.9% -6.2% Momentum Resources Fund (A) -4.7% 8.2% Marriott International Real Estate Feeder Fund (C) -4.4% 3.2% M&G Global Bond Feeder Fund (A) -3.4% 2.6% 1NVEST Global Government Bond Index Feeder Fund (A) -3.3% 1.2% Sanlam Global Emerging Markets Feeder Fund (A1) -3.0% 4.0% M&G Global Property Feeder Fund (A) -2.8% 1NVEST Global Government Bond Index Feeder ETF () -2.5% 1.5% FNB World Government Bond ETF () -2.5% 1.3% Sygnia Health Innovation Global Equity Fund (A) -2.3% PortfolioMetrix BCI Global Bond Fund of Funds (A) -2.2% Nedgroup Investments Mining & Resource Fund (A) -1.7% 10.3% Coronation Resources Fund (P) -1.7% 17.2% Source: Profile Data published on Moneyweb\nRead: Collective investment schemes may pay more tax\nJavaScript is disabled in this browser.
