Vladimir Guerrero Jr. agrees $28,500,000 salary with Blue Jays, per insider Discuss Now Vladimir Guerrero Jr. agrees $28,500,000 salary with Blue Jays, per insider - Source: Imagn The Toronto Blue Jays and star Vladimir Guerrero Jr. have agreed on a one-year, $28.5 million deal, according to team insider Shi Davidi. News of the deal comes ahead of the filing deadline on Thursday.\nWith the deal, the Blue Jays and Guerrero avoid arbitration by settling on a one-year deal for the second season in a row.\nExpand Tweet Trending •\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now Had both sides gone to arbitration, the deal could have been worth as much as $29.6 million, per Sportsnet.\nLast winter, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and the Blue Jays went to arbitration, with Guerrero winning, getting an award of $19.9 million. The Blue Jays had countered at $18.05 million.\nGuerrero was coming off a relatively down year in 2023 after hitting 26 home runs and driving in 94 runs. However, he bounced back last season, hitting 30 dingers and driving in 103 runs. Guerrero made the All-Star team and earned a Silver Slugger award to go with a .323 batting average.\nThis season, the Blue Jays hope Guerrero can return to his 2021 form in which he hit 48 round-trippers and knocked in 111 runs, finishing second in AL MVP voting.\nWhile the deal avoids a major problem for both sides, it remains to be seen whether Vladimir Guerrero Jr. ultimately stays in Toronto or chooses to find greener pastures elsewhere.\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. and Blue Jays far apart on an extension One of the major topics this offseason has been a potential contract extension between the Blue Jays and Vladimir Guerrero Jr . Despite ongoing talks, the two sides seemed quite aways apart.\nAccording to insider Bob Nightengale, the Blue Jays and Guerrero Jr. were reportedly “at least $100 million apart.”\nExpand Tweet That figure seems like a vast chasm that could be challenging to bridge. While the deal’s term is unclear, Guerrero Jr.’s AAV is likely in the $30 million range.\nIf that’s the case, the Blue Jays and Guerrero could have a tug of war around $300 million for roughly 10 years.\nSuch a deal doesn’t seem outrageous, particularly in light of Juan Soto’s record-breaking deal of $765 million this offseason with the New York Mets .\nAs such, the Blue Jays may have no other choice but to pay Guerrero his asking price. Otherwise, Guerrero could become one of the most sought-after free agents. It’s certainly possible that Guerrero will test the free-agent waters when the time comes.\nNevertheless, there’s no telling what the market could be for Guerrero if he has a huge season in 2025. Guerrero is betting on himself while the Blue Jays are merely buying time to figure out a long-term solution.\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?
