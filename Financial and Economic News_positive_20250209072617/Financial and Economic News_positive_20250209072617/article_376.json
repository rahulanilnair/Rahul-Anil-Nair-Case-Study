VNA/VNS Photo Dương Giang HÀ NỘI Minister of Health Đào Hồng Lan has responded to voters' proposals about adding screening for common cancers to the list of services covered by health insurance.\nAhead of the 8th session of the 15th National Assembly, voters from Huế expressed concerns that early screening and detection of dangerous cancers, such as cervical, thyroid and breast cancer, could significantly reduce treatment costs.\nHowever, currently, these cancer screening services are not covered by health insurance.\nThe voters requested that the Ministry of Health and relevant authorities consider adding these screenings to the list of services covered by health insurance (HI) to help alleviate costs for patients.\nIn her written response, Minister Đào Hồng Lan acknowledged that the ministry had received numerous proposals from voters on expanding the list of medical services eligible for HI reimbursement, including cancer screenings. She emphasised that these proposals were being carefully studied to broaden insurance coverage and improve public health benefits.\nHowever, according to the minister, adding new services requires comprehensive studies on related factors, such as insurance premiums, coverage levels and service management, to prevent abuse and ensure a balanced approach. She noted the need to harmonise the Government's provision of preventive services funded by the state budget with treatment costs covered by the health insurance fund.\nMinister Lan explained that in 2024, during the drafting of the amendment to the Law on Health Insurance, the Government submitted a proposal to the National Assembly outlining principles for the inclusion of medical services for diagnosis, risk assessment and preventive treatment of high-prevalence diseases with significant health impacts. This included cervical cancer, breast cancer, hepatitis B and C, diabetes and hypertension, provided there is scientific evidence of the benefits of early intervention and sufficient impact assessments to ensure the sustainability of the health insurance fund.\n\"Expanding the list of reimbursable medical services requires further detailed study, the development of specialised guidelines and the preparation of necessary conditions. This will form the basis for comprehensive amendments to the Law on Health Insurance or, if necessary, piloting before formal regulation,\" Minister Đào Hồng Lan stated.\nA woman undergoing breast cancer screening in Vĩnh Phúc. VNA/VNS Photo Nguyễn Thảo According to the minister, several cancer screening programmes have been implemented in the community, such as cervical and breast cancer screenings. Additionally, free or low-cost screening programmes have been launched for high-risk groups.\nHealth ministry's Circulars No 39/2024 and No 35/2016 include several technical services for early cancer detection, improving treatment outcomes and increasing HI benefits for patients diagnosed with cancer.\nOn average, Việt Nam has approximately 182,000 new cancer cases and over 122,000 cancer-related deaths annually, with about 350,000 individuals currently living with cancer.\nStatistics from Vietnam Social Security indicate that in 2023, the Health Insurance Fund paid nearly VNĐ6.2 trillion (US$243.5 million) for the treatment of six common cancers (breast, lung, liver, colon, stomach and prostate). Treatment costs for patients diagnosed at later stages are significantly higher.\nIn the Policy Impact Assessment Report for the Draft Law amending and supplementing certain articles of the Health Insurance Law (open for public comment since February 2024), the Ministry of Health estimated that the annual screening costs for cervical cancer range from VNĐ2.6 trillion (US$102.2 million) to VNĐ3 trillion ($118 million) and for breast cancer from VNĐ2.5 trillion ($98.3 million) to VNĐ5.3 trillion ($208.3 million). Many countries have implemented health insurance coverage for these screenings.\nMeanwhile, the average annual treatment costs for cervical cancer patients across stages I to IV are approximately VNĐ89.8 million ($3,525) to VNĐ136.9 million ($5,374).\nEarly detection of cervical cancer (stage I) can save patients between VNĐ47 million ($1,847) and VNĐ48.6 million ($1,909) annually compared to those diagnosed at later stages.\nSimilarly, early detection of breast cancer can save patients between VNĐ7.9 million ($310) and VNĐ18.3 million ($718) annually.
