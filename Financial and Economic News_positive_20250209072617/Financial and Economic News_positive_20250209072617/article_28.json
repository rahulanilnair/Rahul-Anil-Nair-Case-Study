    "text": "Sarasota County expects another $210 million in federal hurricane recovery funds Christian Casale , Earle Kimel Sarasota Herald-Tribune Sarasota County expects to receive about $210 million more in recovery funds from the federal government after a trio of storms brought devastating flooding and wind damage over the past two hurricane seasons.\nAfter jumping through the necessary bureaucratic hoops, the county expects the block grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to assist in long-term recovery from Hurricane Idalia in 2023 and Hurricanes Debby , Helene , and Milton in 2024.\nThe new funding will come through Sarasota County’s Resilient SRQ program , which distributed similar federal funding for Hurricane Ian relief. The new block grant would be slightly more than Sarasota County received for Hurricane Ian.\n“With this funding, we’re not just repairing homes and infrastructure — we’re building back stronger and preparing for the future,” County Commission Chairman Joe Neunder said in a statement.\nSteve Hyatt, who oversees the Resilient SRQ program, said during a virtual press conference Thursday morning that the funds can be used throughout Sarasota County after the quartet of hurricanes over the past few years caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.\n“All of this information and this unmet needs analysis and the proposed uses of funds goes before the Sarasota County Board of County Commissioners for their review and input,” Hyatt said. “And before final approval of that action plan, before it’s submitted to HUD.\n“We can use these funds in the entire Sarasota County area, so there’s no specific requirement that they be concentrated to a certain community,” Hyatt said.\nHowever, HUD must find the county's spending plan satisfactory under a number of federal guidelines before it will green-light the disbursement of funding, such as that at least half of the money must go toward low-to-moderate income households.\nHyatt foresees a “several-month process” of county engagement with the affected community members and local municipalities − such as the cities of Sarasota, Venice, and North Port − before a plan is developed, published and submitted to HUD.\nHyatt said that because of new HUD rules he expects a quicker funding approval process.\nCounty officials took about two months to develop a draft plan for spending federal funds in 2023 and another two months for the County Commission to approve it in September. Finalizing Resilient SRQ rules and funding began in 2024.\nFederal funds do not come close to compensating for the sweeping damage caused by the run of historic Gulf storms. The county found that after Hurricane Ian that there were about $700 million to $800 million in unmet needs, but only $201 million in funding to address them.\nAbout $100 million of the Resilient SRQ funding so far has gone toward housing programs − reconstruction and rehabilitation, new affordable housing, and voluntary buyouts. More than $70 million was allotted to infrastructure projects and disbursed to nonprofits and local municipalities. The money has also been involved in discussion of widening River Road to six lanes for use as an evacuation corridor.\nSome of the funding went far more indirectly toward hurricane relief. The County Commission in 2024 cleared $7.5 million for a trade school led by Jon Mast, the former business partner of then-Board Chair and current Tax Collector Mike Moran and husband of Commissioner Teresa Mast, who now represents Moran’s district.\nA Charlotte County spokesperson said it did not receive any federal funding for hurricane recovery. The HUD block grant funding is only available for eligible “urban counties” with populations greater than 200,000 or municipalities with a population of at least 50,000, though Charlotte was impacted by the same storms as Sarasota County.\nThe 2023 Census Bureau estimates puts Charlotte's population at 206,134, but a recalculation to increase the official population to above that threshold will not occur until October 2025, spokesman Brian Gleason added.\nCharlotte County officials are seeking other federal grants, Gleason said, and later noted that the cost to stabilize Englewood Beach, on the southern portion of Manasota Key, is projected at $30 million.\nChristian Casale covers local government for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune.
