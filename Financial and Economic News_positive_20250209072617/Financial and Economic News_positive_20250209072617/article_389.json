    "text": "Share Share Video Link copied! Urias and the Orioles agreed to a one-year, $3.2 million contract to avoid arbitration Thursday, Roch Kubatko of MASNSports.com reports.\nUrias is one of Baltimore's top utility infield options, and he earned 301 plate appearances in 2024. He matched his career-best mark with a 115 wRC+, though he still had only 11 homers and one stolen base. Urias will earn a $1.1 million raise from 2024.\nMore News Orioles' Ramon Urias: Homers in win 09/25/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Orioles' Ramon Urias: Activated, starting at third base 09/22/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Orioles' Ramon Urias: Slated for rehab assignment 09/18/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Orioles' Ramon Urias: Runs bases Tuesday 09/17/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Orioles' Ramon Urias: Nearing baseball activities 09/06/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Orioles' Ramon Urias: Using crutches 09/02/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Baseball Stories What you missed after football started Scott White • 27 min read Bust scenarios for first-rounders Chris Towers • 14 min read Tracker: Giants land Verlander Scott White • 51 min read Top 150 Dynasty rankings Scott White • 1 min read Lux trade raises questions in Cincy Chris Towers • 4 min read First look at 2025 rankings Chris Towers • 8 min read",
