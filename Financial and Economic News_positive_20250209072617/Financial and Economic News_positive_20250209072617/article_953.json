    "text": "Investors who still want to be exposed to growth in 2025, yet are worried about rising valuations in a potentially correction-prone market, have tough choices to make this year. In my view, the field of buyable stocks is narrow, as\nGitLab: Buy This Rule Of 40 Software Growth Story As It Hits Profit Inflection\nSummary\n- GitLab is a fantastic “growth at a reasonable price” stock, trading at <10x revenue despite 30%+ revenue growth.\n- The company is also a “Rule of 40” stock and trades below other peers like Atlassian with a similar financial profile.\n- The company addresses a massive $40 billion market and is benefiting from companies ripping out siloed solutions for GitLab’s integrated approach.\n- Operating margins recently hit double-digits after expanding 10 points y/y, with the company positioned to generate meaningful profit growth in 2025.\nAnalyst’s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of GTLB either through stock ownership, options, or other derivatives.
