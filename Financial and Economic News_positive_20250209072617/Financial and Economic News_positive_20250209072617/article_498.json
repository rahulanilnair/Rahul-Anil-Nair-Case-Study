    "text": "Ohioâ€™s 11 casinos and racinos reported $198.2 million of gambling revenue in November, $3 million more than in October.\nThe same casinos and racinos also generated more revenue than they did this time last year, when they reported $186.1 million in revenue for November, according to data from the Ohio Casino Control and Lottery commissions.\nThe revenue figures are the money the gambling houses keep after paying out winnings but before state taxes and fees are assessed.\nThe four casinos that can offer slot machines and tabletop games such as blackjack reported $84.3 million in gambling revenue in November, up from $80.4 million in the same month last year.",
