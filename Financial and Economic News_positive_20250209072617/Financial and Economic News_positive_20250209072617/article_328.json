Honestly, the Sultan of Oman, and the Ministry of Commerce, made sure that we and the other government agencies attended all the meetings and participated actively.

This will be one of the items on the agenda to discuss the progress on various aspects. But I can let you know that there is a lot of interest from Indian investors in Oman. And we've had several, I would say, larger investors having interest in Oman. And they're already planning for the future. They're already seeing the opportunity, if this CEPA takes place, they're not waiting for it to happen. They're very shrewd. And they're already planning...And that's why India is one of the top three, four countries that are interested in investing in Oman.\" (ANI)\n(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)",
