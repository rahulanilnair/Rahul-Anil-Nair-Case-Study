IT’S A LIST OF NICE AND ALLEGEDLY NAUGHTY JINGLE FINANCE ISSUES, AND IT WAS STARTED BY A SANTA. I’M A SANTA CLAUS. ALAN HOLSTON WAS HIRED BY JINGLE SAINT LOUIS TO PLAY SANTA. HE DID FIVE NIGHTS ONLY PAID FOR THREE. HE’S NOW ORGANIZING OTHER JINGLE PERFORMERS AND STAFF. HE’S CONTACTED A LABOR ATTORNEY ON THEIR NEXT STEPS. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE 47 PEOPLE.

ALL HER EMAILS TO ACCOUNTING AND PAYROLL UNANSWERED. JUST SOMETHING THAT SAID, I’M OUT OF THE OFFICE UNTIL JANUARY SECOND. JINGLE PR SAYS THE EVENT HAD PROBLEMS FROM THE START. THEY ALSO SAY THEY’VE SELF-REPORTED THE PAYROLL ISSUE TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, AN INJUSTICE TOWARDS THE PEOPLE THAT WORK SO HARD IN SOME, YOU KNOW, HARD CONDITIONS. SO SANTA CHECKS THIS LIST MORE THAN TWICE TO SORT THROUGH SOME ALLEGED NAUGHTY FINANCES. FROM THE NICE. HE SAYS HE WANTS JINGLE PRESIDENT MARK MCKEE TO SOLVE THIS. BUT NOW WE HAVE AN ISSUE. NOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM, IT SEEMS TO WHERE AN ENTREPRENEUR GOT OVER THEIR HEAD, MAYBE GOT TOO BIG TOO FAST, TRIED TO DO TOO MANY LOCATIONS, DIDN’T HAVE THE CASH FLOW TO SUPPORT WHAT HE WAS DOING. SO HOW CAN JINGLE WORKERS TRY AND GET INVOLVED IN THIS POSSIBLE LEGAL ACTION? WELL, THEY CAN LOOK UP THIS GOOGLE DOC. WE DO HAVE A LINK TO IT THAT WILL BE LINKED TO THIS STORY ON OUR WEBSITE. IT LOOKS LIKE THAT RIGHT THERE. THEY CAN ENTER THEIR INFORMATION. IT WILL GO INTO A SPREADSHEET AND BE USED FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE LEGAL RECOURSE. THEY CAN GO THERE MEETING WITH MISSOURI LABOR ATTORNEY RIGHT NOW. AND I DID SPEAK. I PUT IN ABOUT SEVEN PHONE CALLS, ABOUT SEVEN DIFFERENT EMAILS TO PAYROLL AND BOOKING SERVICES THAT WORKED FOR JINGLE, AND I HAVEN’T RECEIVED A RESPONSE YET. I ALSO REACHED OUT TO MARK MCKEE’S ATTORNEY, AND WE ARE STILL WAITING ON A RESPONSE. WE’LL STAY ON THIS.
