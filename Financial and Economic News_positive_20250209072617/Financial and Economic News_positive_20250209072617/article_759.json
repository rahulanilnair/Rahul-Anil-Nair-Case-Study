    "text": "Volkswagen delivered 4.8 million units in 2024, with SUVs accounting for 47% of its sales. The Tiguan was the best-selling VW, followed by the T-Roc that will be renewed in 2025. China remains VW’s biggest market with 2.2 million sales in 2024 despite an 8.3% decline. The Volkswagen brand recorded global sales of 4.8 million vehicles in 2024, reflecting a 1.4% decline compared to the previous year. Among these, 383,100 were fully electric vehicles, representing a 2.7% year-on-year drop.\nThe Volkswagen brand recorded global sales of 4.8 million vehicles in 2024, reflecting a 1.4% decline compared to the previous year. While the overall dip was modest, it underscores the growing challenges posed by increasing competition and evolving market demands. Of these sales, 383,100 were fully electric vehicles (EVs), a 2.7% decrease year-on-year, an unwelcome result for a company striving to strengthen its EV presence.\nChina remained Volkswagen’s largest market in 2024, with 2.2 million deliveries accounting for nearly 46% of all sales. However, this marked an 8.3% decline from 2023 as local brands intensified their competitive edge. In Europe, Volkswagen retained its position as the market leader with 1.25 million units, despite a slight decrease of 1.7%.\nMore: Massive VW Data Leak Exposed 800,000 EV Owners’ Movements, From Homes To Brothels\nNorth America was the third biggest region for VW with 592,300 deliveries and a robust 18.4 percent increase compared to last year. Volkswagen also enjoyed a good year in South America, where it posted a 21.1 percent increase with 479,400 deliveries. The vast majority of South American sales took place in Brazil, where the Polo hatchback sold a record 172,510 units.\nVW BRAND SALES GLOBAL\nRegion Sales Change Europe 1,254,500 units -1.7% South America 479,400 units +21.1% North America 592,300 units +18.4% China 2,198,900 units -8.3% SWIPE In Germany , Volkswagen continued to dominate, maintaining a 19.1% market share. According to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), the brand held five spots in the country’s top ten best-selling vehicles chart with the Golf , T-Roc, Tiguan, Passat, and Polo.\nGlobally, the Tiguan was Volkswagen’s best-selling model in 2024, followed by the smaller T-Roc that will enter a new generation in 2025 . SUVs accounted for 47 percent of global VW deliveries in 2024, explaining why the automaker continues to expand its lineup of high-riding models.\nMore: VW Slashes Manager Bonuses By 10% For Two Years, Plans More Cuts Through 2030\nAs for electric vehicles , the 383,100 deliveries of 2024 were 2.7 percent fewer compared to the 393,700 of 2023. The stop sale order for the VW ID.4 last year is certainly one of the reasons for the decline, as it resulted in 55% fewer sales for the electric SUV in the US market .\nMartin Sander, Volkswagen Board Member for Sales, Marketing and After Sales, said: “Around the globe, 2024 was a difficult year with sluggish economic activity, political challenges and intense competition – particularly in China. Yet, we are beginning the new year with optimism. Not only do we have attractive products, but we are meeting the needs of a wide variety of customer groups with our extensive, diverse model range that covers all drive types.”\nIn the coming weeks we expect the 2024 sales numbers for the entire VW Group, which is expected to remain the second largest automaker in the world behind Toyota .",
