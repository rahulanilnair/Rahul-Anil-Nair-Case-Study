    "text": "Mark Cuban believes Bitcoin has more value than gold as a store of wealth.\nIn a recent interview, Cuban highlighted Bitcoin’s practicality and its potential advantage in an economic crisis.\n“People see [gold] as an option in the event of the economy going down or something bad happening.”\n“People look at Bitcoin as a better version of gold, and I agree with that.”\nWhile gold has long been viewed as a hedge during inflation and downturns, Cuban points out its drawbacks: it’s heavy, easy to steal, and impractical for transactions.\nBitcoin, by contrast, is portable, divisible, and easy to use for transactions or transfers, even across borders.\nCuban argues this makes it more functional than gold, both as a store of value and as a currency.\nMostrar comentarios",
