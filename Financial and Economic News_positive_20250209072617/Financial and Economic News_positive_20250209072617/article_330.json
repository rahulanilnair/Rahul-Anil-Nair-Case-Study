    "text": "Canadian fashion retailer Aritzia announced on Thursday a 11.5% increase in net revenue, for the third quarter ended December 1.\nAritzia reports 11.5% revenue growth in Q3. - Aritzia\nThe Vancouver-based company said net revenues reached $728.7 million, compared to $653.5 million in Q3 2024, while comparable sales grew 6.6%, as all channels and all geographies climbed positively.\nBy region, in the United States, net revenue surged by 23.6% to $403.7 million, compared to $326.6 million in Q3 2024, driven by the company's real estate expansion strategy and further acceleration in eCommerce growth.\nAds Meanwhile, in Canada, the brand's home turf, net revenue decreased 0.6% to $325 million, compared to $326.9 million in Q3 2024, due to the shift of the annual warehouse sale and the occurrence of the Digital Archive Sale in Q3 2024.\nAritzia's retail net revenue increased by 10.3% to $486.6 million, compared to $441.1 million in Q3 2024, driven by strong performance of the company's new and repositioned boutiques, as well as a positive response to the company's Fall and Winter product.\nLikewise, e-commerce net revenue equally climbed 14% to $242.1 million, compared to $212.5 million in Q3 2024.\nNet income was $74.1 million, an increase of 71.9% compared to $43.1 million in Q3 2024, while net income per diluted share was $0.63 per share, an increase of 65.8% compared to $0.38 per share.\n\"Our strong performance in the third quarter of Fiscal 2025 underscores the progress we've made across key areas of our business. We delivered a 12% increase in net revenue compared to the third quarter of Fiscal 2024, as we drove accelerated momentum in eCommerce and executed on our real estate expansion strategy, including the opening of two brand-propelling flagships, one in SoHo and one on Michigan Avenue,” said Jennifer Wong, chief executive officer.\n“We are particularly pleased with the outstanding performance of our business in the United States where net revenue increased 24%, illustrating the strength of the Aritzia brand and growing affinity for our Everyday Luxury offering. We also continued to meaningfully improve our Adjusted EBITDA margin, with a focus on regaining our historical levels in the high-teens.”\nLooking ahead, Aritzia expects fourth quarter net revenue in the range of $830 million to $850 million, representing growth of approximately 22% to 25%. For the full fiscal year, Aritzia is forecasting net revenue in the range of $2.67 billion to $2.69 billion, representing growth of approximately 15% from Fiscal 2024.\n\"Our momentum has continued into the fourth quarter, as a strong inventory position and positive client response to our Winter assortment helped drive record-breaking sales over the holiday period. Looking to the future, we remain steadfast in advancing our key growth levers. We have several initiatives underway to help fuel an ongoing acceleration in e-commerce trends, as well as another exciting pipeline of boutiques planned for the next fiscal year,” Wong added.\nCopyright © 2025 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved.",
