As Bitcoin (BTC) continues its pullback into the low $90,000 range, analysts are divided on how much further the top cryptocurrency might fall before a potential bounce. However, long-term market observers remain confident, emphasizing that short-term price action does not alter their belief in BTC’s eventual rise to a million dollars or more in the coming years.\nBitcoin To Reach $1.5 Million By 2035 Cryptocurrency enthusiast Timothy Peterson recently shared his projection on X, predicting that Bitcoin is on track to reach $1.5 million by 2035, based on Metcalfe’s Law. This forecast represents an almost 15-fold increase from its current price over the next decade.\nSource: Timothy Peterson on X For the uninitiated, Metcalfe’s Law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users, meaning as the number of participants grows, the network’s utility and value increase exponentially. In Bitcoin’s context, this suggests that its value rises significantly as more people adopt and use the network.\nRelated Reading Bitcoin May Rally In Q1 2025 Driven By US Fed’s Money Printing, Predicts Arthur Hayes 22 hours ago\nPeterson is the author of the widely discussed paper titled “Metcalfe’s Law as a Model for Bitcoin’s Value”, which uses the law to project Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Known for his bullish stance on Bitcoin, Peterson has long argued that BTC’s global adoption is inevitable. His paper states:\nTraditional currency models fail with bitcoin, but various mathematical laws which explain network connectivity offer compelling explanation of its value.\nPeterson has also demonstrated accuracy in identifying key market trend reversals. For instance, he correctly identified Bitcoin’s local bottom in September of last year.\nBTC To Dip Further Before Bounce? While Peterson’s bullish $1.5 million prediction is music to the ears of Bitcoin bulls, the cryptocurrency’s current price action might leave them uneasy. At the time of writing, over $524 million worth of liquidations have occurred in the past 24 hours, with $136 million in BTC alone.\nRelated Reading Bitcoin Sell-Off Likely When This Metric Reaches 4%, Analyst Explains 3 weeks ago\nCrypto analyst Keith Alan weighed in on Bitcoin’s recent price movement, stating that “this dip isn’t done dipping.” According to Alan, the sell-side pressure is actively pushing the price down, with buyers seemingly waiting for lower levels to make significant purchases. He explained:\nIt’s clear that the sell side is trying to push the price down. It’s not clear if the buy walls are related to the same entity pushing price down, but what is clear is that they have no conviction for those price levels, and some or all of this liquidity could move or spoof.\nAlan identified $91,500 as a potential support level, with $86,500 acting as a secondary line of defense. He noted that more than $300 million in bid liquidity exists within this range, making it likely that BTC could rebound from these levels.\nAlan also highlighted that a drop to $86,500 would represent a 20% decline from Bitcoin’s recent all-time high (ATH) of $108,135. However, if this support fails to hold, there is a risk of BTC sliding further to $77,900 to fill the CME gap.\nOn the contrary, crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently emphasized that BTC may be on track to $275,000 based on the cup and handle pattern formation on the weekly chart. At press time, BTC trades at $92,805, down 3.3% in the past 24 hours.\nBTC trades at $92,805 on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on TradingView.com Featured image from Unsplash, Charts from X and TradingView.com Tweet 123 Share 196 Share Send Ash Tiwari\nAsh is a dedicated crypto researcher and blockchain enthusiast with a passion for diving deep into the evolving world of decentralized technologies.
