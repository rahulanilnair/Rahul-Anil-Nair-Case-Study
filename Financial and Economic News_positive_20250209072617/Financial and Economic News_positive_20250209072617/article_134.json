    "text": "Advanced smart meters: consumers save 30cr on power bills\nIndore: Advanced [smart meters](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/smart-meters) for electricity are proving to be beneficial and economically advantageous for consumers. So far, these consumers received discounts of around Rs 30 crore on approximately 7 lakh bills by calculating the [power factor](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/power-factor).\n[Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Madhya-Pradesh-Paschim-Kshetra-Vidyut-Vitaran-Company-Limited) (MPPKVVCL) managing director Rajni Singh said that smart meters take precise readings, leading to a significant reduction in complaints. \"Smart meters also record the power factor, and if it is above 0.85 for non-domestic consumers, a discount of one rupee per unit is provided according to the regulatory commission,\" Singh said.\nShe added that this discount is given because a correct power factor ensures the electricity line, grid, and resources operate in optimal condition. The MD stated that so far, smart meters in the urban area of Indore provided discounts of Rs 18 crore on 4 lakh bills.\n\"Discounts of approximately Rs 2 crore in Ujjain, Rs 1.5 crore in Ratlam, Rs 80 lakh in Khargone, Rs 40 lakh in Dr Ambedkar Nagar (Mhow), and as many in Dewas have been provided,\" she said, adding that advanced smart meters benefited eligible consumers in Pithampur, Dhar, Jhabua, Thandla, Jaora, Shajapur, Khandwa, Barwani, Sendhwa, Agar, Mandsaur, Neemuch, Jobat, Alirajpur, and Ranapur with timely power factor discounts.\nShe said that by the first week of January this year, over 9.5 lakh smart meters were installed in more than 50 municipal bodies in the company area, and consumers with smart meters are also availing benefits of the Atal Griha Jyoti Yojana.",
