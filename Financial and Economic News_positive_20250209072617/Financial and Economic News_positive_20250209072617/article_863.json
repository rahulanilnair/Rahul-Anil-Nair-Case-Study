    "text": "[XRP’s potential](https://captainaltcoin.com/is-xrp-price-set-for-a-500-rally-crypto-expert-breaks-it-down/) for a price surge is visible and could happen soon amid the broader market’s downturn. With precise technical analysis, analyst Ali Charts has shared key entry levels and a bullish target.\nThe expert’s insights focus on XRP’s consolidation phase, critical price zones, and projected targets. Moreover, Ali believes [XRP](https://captainaltcoin.com/ripple-xrp-price-prediction/) could hit $10, providing opportunities for traders to strategize their positions effectively.\nXRP Price Pattern Signals a Bullish Outlook\nAccording to Ali’s chart, XRP is forming a classic pennant pattern. This technical structure typically signals a continuation of the prevailing trend. The pennant pattern consists of converging trendlines that represent declining volatility.\nAli’s analysis suggests XRP may soon break out of this consolidation phase, setting the stage for a strong upward move. The rising trendline, connecting higher lows, acts as a support level during this consolidation.\nThe declining trendline, which links lower highs, indicates resistance. Ali emphasized that the convergence of these lines points to a potential breakout, which traders should monitor closely.\nTwo Key Entry Points Highlighted\nAli Charts identified two critical entry points for traders seeking to capitalize on XRP’s bullish momentum. The first level is $2.05, aligning with the pennant’s rising trendline. This entry point offers a lower-risk position within the consolidation phase.\nThe second entry level is $2.50, marking the breakout point outside the pennant. A confirmed breakout above this [price signals](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/ripples-xrp-plunges-over-4-following-funding-rates-decline-202501100045) a strong bullish move, according to Ali. Traders can select their entry level based on their risk tolerance and confirmation preferences.\nRead also: [YouTube Analyst Shares ‘Realistic’ Cardano Price Prediction](https://captainaltcoin.com/youtube-analyst-shares-realistic-cardano-price-prediction/)\nXRP Targeting a $10 Price Level\nAli Charts’ analysis projects a target of $10 for XRP. This target is derived from the pennant’s flagpole height, which measures the prior rally’s strength. The projection also aligns with key Fibonacci levels, further validating the $10 target.\nFibonacci extensions suggest additional resistance levels at $4.73, $6.09, $8.76, and $11.82. These levels provide milestones for XRP as it climbs toward its ambitious target.\nPer CoinGecko, XRP is [trading at $2.30](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xrp), reflecting a 24-hour decline of 2.17% at press time. Despite this, Ali Charts maintains confidence in XRP’s bullish outlook, emphasizing the significance of strategic entry points for potential gains.\nFollow us on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/CaptainAltcoin_), [CoinMarketCap ](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/CaptainAltcoin/)and [Binance Square](https://www.binance.com/en/square/profile/captainaltcoin) for more daily crypto updates.\nGet all our future calls by joining our [FREE Telegram group.](https://t.me/captainaltcoincom)\n[\nWe recommend eToro\n](https://captainaltcoin.com/go/etoro/)\n[Take 2 mins to learn more](https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/terms-conditions/trading-restriction/)\nWide range of assets: cryptocurrencies alongside other investment products such as stocks and ETFs.\nCopy trading: allows users to copy the trades of leading traders, for free.\nUser-friendly: eToro’s web-based platform and mobile app are user-friendly and easy to navigate.",
