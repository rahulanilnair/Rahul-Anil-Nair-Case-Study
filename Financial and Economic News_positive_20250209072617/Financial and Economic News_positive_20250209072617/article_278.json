    "text": "The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released data for November 2024 global passenger demand with the following highlights:\nTotal demand, measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), was up 8.1% compared to November 2023. Total capacity, measured in available seat kilometers (ASK), was up 5.7% year-on-year. The November load factor was 83.4% (+1.9 ppt compared to November 2023), an all-time high for November. International demand rose 11.6% compared to November 2023. Capacity was up 8.6% year-on-year, and the load factor was 83.4% (+2.3 ppt compared to November 2023). Strong performance by carriers in Europe and Asia-Pacific drove this double-digit expansion in demand. Domestic demand rose 3.1% compared to November 2023. Capacity was up 1.5% year-on-year and the load factor was 83.5% (+1.2 ppt compared to November 2023). “November was another month of strong growth in the demand for air travel with an overall expansion of 8.1%. The month was also another reminder of the supply chain issues that are preventing airlines from getting the aircraft they need to meet growing demand.\nCapacity growth is lagging demand by 2.4 ppts and load factors are at record levels.\nAirlines are missing out on opportunities to better serve customers, modernize their products and improve their environmental performance because aircraft are not being delivered on time.\nThe 2025 New Year’s resolution for the aerospace manufacturing sector must be finding a fast and durable solution for their supply chain issues,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.\nAir passenger market in detail – November 2024\nNovember 2024\n(% year-on-year) World share1 RPK ASK PLF (%-pt) PLF (level)\nTotal Market 100% 8.1% 5.7% 1.9% 83.4%\nAfrica 2.1% 10.9% 6.0% 3.3% 73.3%\nAsia Pacific 31.7% 14.0% 9.0% 3.7% 84.9%\nEurope 27.1% 8.3% 6.1% 1.7% 85.3%\nLatin America 5.5% 7.0% 6.6% 0.4% 84.5%\nMiddle East 9.4% 8.9% 4.1% 3.6% 81.2%\nNorth America 24.2% -0.7% 1.0% -1.4% 81.0%\n1% of industry RPKs in 2023\nRegional Breakdown – International Passenger Markets\nAll regions showed growth for international passenger markets in November 2024 compared to November 2023. Europe had the highest load factors (85.0%) while Asia-Pacific led on growth with a 19.9% year-on-year expansion in demand.\nAsia-Pacific airlines achieved a 19.9% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 16.2% year-on-year and the load factor was 84.9% (+2.6 ppt compared to November 2023).\nEuropean carriers had a 9.4% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 7.1% year-on-year, and the load factor was 85.0 % (+1.8 ppt compared to November 2023).\nMiddle Eastern carriers saw an 8.7% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 3.9% year-on-year and the load factor was 81.0% (+3.6 ppt compared to November 2023).\nNorth American carriers saw a 3.1% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 1.6% year-on-year, and the load factor was 81.0% (+1.1 ppt compared to November 2023).\nLatin American airlines saw an 11.4% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity climbed 11.9% year-on-year. The load factor was 84.4% (-0.4 ppt compared to November 2023).\nAfrican airlines saw a 12.4% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity was up 6.0% year-on-year. The load factor rose to 72.9% (+4.1 ppt compared to November 2023).\nDomestic Passenger Markets\nDomestic RPK increased 3.1% over the previous year, decelerating slightly from the 3.5% growth posted in October. Signs of stable growth were shown in all markets except in the US which saw a 2.7% contraction, deeper than the 1.2% year-on-year dip recorded in October. This is part of a slowing trend in the US domestic market since June 2024 and mainly reflects lower low-cost carrier activity. US mainline carriers have continued to see growth over the same period.\nAir passenger market in detail – November 2024\nNovember 2024\n(% year-on-year) World share1 RPK ASK PLF (%-pt) PLF (level)\nDomestic 39.9% 3.1% 1.5% 1.2% 83.5%\nDom.
