    "text": "New leadership roles highlight Hallmark’s unique vendor-neutral approach to helping health systems build flexible, efficient, and sustainable workforce strategies\nHallmark , a leading healthcare workforce management technology company, announced the strengthening of its senior team with two strategic roles focused on customer success and vendor partnerships. The move underscores Hallmark’s commitment to helping health systems adopt more flexible workforce strategies that empower their internal teams while optimizing the use of external staffing agencies.\n“By enhancing our team and dedicating specialized leadership to both customer success and partnerships, we’re doubling down on our commitment to deliver workforce solutions that truly work for health systems,” said Bruce Cerullo, CEO of Hallmark. “Our vendor-neutral approach empowers organizations to create internal float pools, offer staff the flexibility they want, and leverage external staffing only when necessary—leading to significant cost savings, improved clinician engagement, and enhanced patient safety.”\nMichelle Lichte has been appointed Chief Client Success Officer.\nShe brings over three decades of experience in healthcare workforce management and operational transformation with a career spanning Epic, Nordic Consulting, and various healthcare organizations where she partnered with clients across the U.S. for EHR implementations and process improvements.\nBrandon Chamberland has been promoted to Chief Strategy and Partnerships Officer, tasked with overseeing relationships with staffing agency vendors and managed service provider (MSP) resellers. He will leverage his expertise in staffing and strategic sourcing to develop innovative collaborations that complement health systems’ internal workforce strategies while maintaining operational transparency and cost efficiency.\nHallmark’s Einstein II solution is a comprehensive platform that empowers health systems to build and manage their own internal float pools and incorporates a vendor management module to seamlessly integrate external staffing agencies when necessary. This innovative approach reduces health system reliance on costly external staffing and creates healthy competition, resulting in a more sustainable and economical workforce model.\n“By maximizing the utilization of permanent staff and internal float pools, Hallmark helps health systems maintain a consistent, engaged workforce while fostering a flexible environment where nurses are empowered to decide how, when, and where they work,” added Cerullo. “The result is a more cohesive team culture, improved clinician satisfaction, and significant cost savings—all while maintaining high-quality patient care.”\nTo learn more about Hallmark’s solutions, visit www.hallmarkhcs.com .\nAbout Hallmark\nHallmark offers a fully integrated SaaS platform for healthcare workforce management.
