    "text": "According to PANews, former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss has expressed her support for [Bitcoin](/trade/BTC_USDT?contentId=18732249968593) and cryptocurrency, stating, 'I am a supporter of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and I think they are great.' Truss, who served as the UK's shortest-serving prime minister, resigned after just 49 days in office due to a mini-budget proposal that led to a surge in borrowing costs.",
