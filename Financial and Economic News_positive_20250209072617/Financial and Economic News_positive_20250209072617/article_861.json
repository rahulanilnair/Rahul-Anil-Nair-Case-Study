    "text": "Yuhan Corporation (000100) is strong on January 10. Shares of Yuhan Corp. closed at 133,000 won the previous day, down 0.52 percent from the close. Currently, it is 136,300 won (as of 9:28), up 2.48% from the previous day's close.\nMK Signal recommended Yuhan to buy on December 24, 24, through AI No. 4, and has a valuation gain/loss return of 18.92% based on the target price and holding strategy before the loss price is reached.\n(Return performance based on MK Signal's investment strategy may vary by investor.)\nPortfolio AI No. 4 selected by artificial intelligence is composed of undervalued large stocks with a market capitalization of more than 1 trillion won, and provides a swing investment strategy signal for large stocks. After the portfolio is incorporated, the maximum holding period is 20 days, the target is 20%, and the loss price is 10%.\nYuhan Corporation (000100) seems to be rising as it releases data showing that the combination therapy of Yuhan Corporation's \"Lekraza\" and Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Innovative Medicine's \"Libryvant\" has an advantage over AstraZeneca's Tagrisso. Yuhan had signed a license and collaboration agreement with Johnson & Johnson to develop Leclaza in 2018.\nMK Signal is currently in the process of 'Free Event for the First Month'!\nU.S. stocks as well as domestic stocks at once!
