    "text": "It's no secret that artificial intelligence, or AI, is the key trend driving the stock market right now, especially when it comes to some of the largest and most popular companies to invest in. But choosing individual AI stocks can be challenging.\nIf you're looking to get AI exposure in your portfolio but aren't sure what stocks are the best opportunities, you might want to consider using exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, to invest instead. Here are five top AI ETFs that could be worth a closer look right now.\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free »\n5 top AI ETFs you can buy right now\nFund Name (Symbol) |\nTotal Assets |\nExpense Ratio |\n---|---|---|\nInvesco QQQ ETF |\n$326.6 billion |\n0.20% |\niShares Future AI & Tech ETF |\n$756 million |\n0.47% |\nInvesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF |\n$428 million |\n0.58% |\nGlobalX Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF |\n$2.71 billion |\n0.68% |\nARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF |\n$947.7 million |\n0.75% |\nInvesco QQQ ETF\nThe Invesco QQQ isn't technically an AI ETF, but it's a fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 index and offers a lot of exposure to the top AI companies at a lower investment cost, or expense ratio, than the other funds discussed here. The fund's top 10 holdings make up 53% of the total assets, and nine of them are clearly AI plays. Top holdings include Apple [(NASDAQ: AAPL)](/market-activity/stocks/aapl), Nvidia [(NASDAQ: NVDA)](/market-activity/stocks/nvda), and Microsoft [(NASDAQ: MSFT)](/market-activity/stocks/msft), but there are also plenty of smaller, high-potential AI stocks, such as Palantir [(NASDAQ: PLTR)](/market-activity/stocks/pltr) and CrowdStrike [(NASDAQ: CRWD)](/market-activity/stocks/crwd), just to name a couple.\niShares Future AI & Tech ETF\nThe iShares Future AI & Tech ETF isn't the best-known fund in the space, but it offers an AI-focused approach for a lower expense ratio that most other specialized AI ETFs. There are a total of 50 stocks in the index the fund tracks, with top holdings including Broadcom [(NASDAQ: AVGO)](/market-activity/stocks/avgo), Arista Networks [(NYSE: ANET)](/market-activity/stocks/anet), and Nvidia.\nInvesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF\nThe Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF is one of the oldest AI ETFs, with an inception date nearly 20 years ago. Since that time, the fund has produced annualized total returns of 12.7% for investors, handily outpacing the S&P 500. The fund's top three holdings include Nvidia, Alphabet [(NASDAQ: GOOGL)](/market-activity/stocks/googl)[(NASDAQ: GOOG)](/market-activity/stocks/goog), and Meta Platforms [(NASDAQ: META)](/market-activity/stocks/meta).\nGlobalX Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF\nThe GlobalX Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF is one of the largest AI-specific ETFs by market cap and owns 84 different stocks. This index fund is unique because the most common AI stocks aren't the largest holdings. Nvidia barely cracks the top 10, for example. The top three stocks are Tesla [(NASDAQ: TSLA)](/market-activity/stocks/tsla), Broadcom, and ServiceNow [(NYSE: NOW)](/market-activity/stocks/now), and this is not a top-heavy ETF. All of the top 10 stocks make up between 3.2% and 4.5% of the fund's assets.\nARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF\nThe ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF is the only actively managed ETF on this list. Instead of tracking an index of AI stocks and attempting to match its performance, this ETF aims to outperform its benchmark by having its managers construct a portfolio. It is a rather concentrated ETF, typically holding 30 to 50 stocks, and aside from Tesla, its top holding, most of the largest stocks are companies you might not be too familiar with. Teradyne [(NASDAQ: TER)](/market-activity/stocks/ter) and Kratos Defense & Security [(NASDAQ: KTOS)](/market-activity/stocks/ktos) are the Nos. 2 and 3 holdings, respectively.\nWhich is best for you?\nThis is a list of five solid AI-focused ETFs, and if you're looking for more exposure to artificial intelligence stocks in your portfolio, I don't think you'll go wrong with any of them (or a combination of a few of them). The best fit for you depends on a few factors, such as how much volatility you're comfortable with, whether your priority is beating the market or simply benefiting from the AI wave, and other factors.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n- Nvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $363,385!*\n- Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $45,870!*\n- Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $474,140!*\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 6, 2025\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.
