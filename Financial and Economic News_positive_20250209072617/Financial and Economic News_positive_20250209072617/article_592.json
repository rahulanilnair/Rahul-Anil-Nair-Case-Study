    "text": "The aesthetics industry is undergoing a major shift, largely fueled by the rise of GLP-1 medications. These treatments are now playing a pivotal role in reshaping what patients are having done while boosting aesthetic practices. In 2024, the $17.5 billion aesthetics industry experienced a 2 percent overall growth, with treatments like Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound driving an impressive 11 percent surge in spending in the nonsurgical category.\nAccording to the numbers, spending on neurotoxin treatments was up 4 percent, and average patient spend rose to $1,471. “GLP-1s are rewriting the playbook for medical aesthetics,” says Erik Haines, managing director at Guidepoint Qsight, a data and analytics firm specializing in healthcare trends. “Not only are they generating significant revenue, but they’re also attracting a new wave of patients—40 percent of whom were first-timers in 2024.”\nThe data speaks volumes. Practices offering GLP-1 treatments reported a 9 percent revenue increase, while those that didn’t saw a 2 percent decline. On average, GLP-1 treatments themselves now contribute 15 percent of monthly revenue for participating providers.\nA Changing Demographic\nIn 2024, the report also finds that Gen Z patients accounted for 10 percent of all aesthetics clientele—nearly three times their presence in 2017. Meanwhile, baby boomers comprised just 20 percent of patients, underscoring a generational pivot toward nonsurgical treatments.\nAccording to survey results, medspas are at the forefront of this change, with 60 percent offering GLP-1 services compared to only 35 percent of aesthetic physician offices. As the demand for nonsurgical treatments grows, GLP-1 weight loss successes have become a lucrative opportunity for practices aiming to attract new clients, giving the industry as a whole a boost.",
