According to TOO FAB, Curtis also announced while appearing on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.\nShe shared that her community has experienced considerable effects from the damage, affecting her local market, the homes of friends, and well-known landmarks. Curtis also urged the audience to assist their communities when there’s an opportunity to support those in need. The Southern California wildfires, which include the Palisades, Eaton, Hurst, Lidia, and Sunset fires, have already necessitated the evacuation of more than 100,000 residents.\nRELATED STORIES: California Governor Gavin Newsom Drags President-Elect Donald Trump After Being Blamed For Deadly Fires In Los Angeles: ‘People Have Lost Their Lives And This Guy Wanted To Politicize It’\nCurtis along with other celebrities have said they have lost their homes to the fires.
