    "text": "Berkeley County Commission accepts grant from West Virginia First Foundation By Tom Markland tmarkland@journal-news.net Jan 9, 2025 Jan 9, 2025 Updated 4 hrs ago Comments Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save MARTINSBURG – Berkeley County commissioners accepted a grant worth more than $600,000 on Thursday from the West Virginia First Foundation.\nThe grant was part of the foundation’s first round of Initial Opportunity Grants, coming from settlement funds intended to help address the opioid crisis.\nIn total, the commission was awarded $625,644.46, which will be spread out among local law enforcement agencies and the county’s community service program.\nAccording to Tim Czaja, Berkeley County Community Corrections director, as well as the West Virginia First Foundation’s Region 2 director, the funds going to law enforcement will be allocated to the three local agencies for various tools to help with drug interdiction, intended to help stem the flow of illegal drugs into local communities.\nCzaja told the county commissioners that $64,090.82 of the funds is earmarked for the Martinsburg Police Department to purchase interdiction equipment, including video equipment, vehicle mountings and drones. For the Berkeley County Sheriff’s Department, $148,876.50 is earmarked for several things, including a drug take-back box, interdiction training for the deputies and a few drug Raman analyzers, which help deputies identify potentially dangerous substances in the field. Another $31,238.29 will go to the West Virginia State Police to buy a Raman analyzer and various other equipment.\nThe remaining $381,438.77 will go to the county’s community service program, headed by Czaja at the Berkeley County Day Report Center. Those funds will go toward adding new staff, including a community service coordinator and two community service specialists. Additionally, $50,000 is earmarked to purchase a vehicle for the program and another $13,680.38 for the cost of the electronic health record system used at the DRC.\nCzaja said a goal for the DRC has been to bolster that program, and the new funds should help with that.\n“There are folks that flow through the courts that are low-level offenders — they haven’t committed a crime that is necessarily jailable. These are folks that are working that we want to keep working,” Czaja explained. “A consequence needs to be served for whatever it was that they did, so community service is one of those options.”\nPeople that are referred to the program by the courts work with local businesses and nonprofit organizations, such as the roadside litter program or the recycling center, where people are sent to complete their hours.\n“We don’t want people to just go and do their hours; we want them to become better people through the process,” Czaja said. “If this is a person that could benefit from some GED classes, life-skills classes or parenting classes, they can complete some of their hours by participating in those classes, so they’re not just picking up trash to be punished. We want them to leave the program better than they were.”\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Site search Search Sign up for newsletters No subscription is required to sign up for Journal newsletters.
