    "text": "India’s GST collections are poised for a strong finish this fiscal year, driven by a resurgence in economic activity, particularly in rural areas, during the second half of the year. This robust tax revenue will play a vital role in helping Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stick to the fiscal glide path while maintaining a strong focus on capital expenditure (capex).The upcoming Budget, the second in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s third term, will be closely watched by global investors. This is particularly significant given the uncertainty in the global economy, which continues to grapple with challenges like the Middle East tensions, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict, and persistently high inflation. 117206012These global headwinds have left investors cautious, with concerns about the unclear trajectory of interest rate cuts adding to their pessimism. However, amid this global volatility, India’s strong economic fundamentals stand out. Despite a slowdown in GDP growth during the second quarter, the economy’s underlying momentum remains robust.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been vigilant in keeping inflation under control, and the forecast for lower inflation in the coming months is a positive sign for households and businesses alike. A reduction in inflationary pressures is expected to boost consumption further, giving an additional push to GST collections. GST collections have demonstrated remarkable resilience in 2024, with the November figure touching Rs 1.82 lakh crore, setting a new monthly record. This strong performance is a testament to the sustained growth of India’s economy. In December, the figure stood at Rs 1.76 lakh crore. The government’s consistent efforts to streamline GST slabs and adjust rates have also contributed to this uptick. Additionally, its strict stance against tax evasion has helped plug leakages and improve compliance. Introduced in 2017, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) marked a transformative reform in India’s indirect tax structure by unifying numerous state and central taxes under a single framework. Over the years, it has become a significant revenue source for the government, facilitating higher tax compliance and transparency. With ongoing reforms to simplify compliance and rationalise tax rates, GST is expected to continue driving India’s economic trajectory. Budget 2025 preparations in full swingAs the government prepares for Budget 2025, the focus will be on sustaining growth momentum while addressing the needs of a diverse and evolving economy. Taxation policies, investment incentives, and welfare schemes will likely play a crucial role in balancing fiscal discipline with the need for strategic expenditure. Continuity in existing policies combined with recalibrations to meet emerging challenges will guide the government’s approach to budget-making. The political landscape will also shape the budget’s direction. With a coalition government now in place, it must align national growth objectives with the priorities of its coalition partners. The challenge will lie in crafting a budget that sustains economic stability, bolsters investor confidence, and fosters inclusive development. Given these dynamics, Budget 2025 will not only reflect the government’s response to global and domestic challenges but also serve as a pivotal document shaping India’s economic trajectory in the years to come.",
