    "text": "[Scottie Pippen](http://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/scottie-pippen//?utm_medium=website&utm_source=website_internal&utm_campaign=web_link_0) remains steadfast in his beliefs. The basketball legend quickly became the talk of the town when he began posting about his positive opinion on a specific matter– Bitcoin. Billionaire Mark Cuban might agree with him. Just last year, Pippen made a surprising prediction on social media. And now he’s doing it again. As Bitcoin sees a major drop in the market, the basketball legend once again doubles down on his stance.\nTaking to social media, Pippen shared a photoshopped picture of himself holding the symbol representing Bitcoin. Along with the image, he conveyed the message that he won’t be intimidated by current events. “They can try to scare us out, but I’m not letting go of my Bitcoin,” Pippen captioned his post.\nAs per ET Times, Bitcoin fell by over 5%, dropping to $96,200 after previously reaching $100,000. This decline was witnessed after U.S. economic data showed the economy was strong, suggesting fewer Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nBut Pippen isn’t alone in his beliefs. Another business savvy who showed a similar faith was Mark Cuban.\nThey can try to scare us out, but I’m not letting go of my Bitcoin.\n[pic.twitter.com/Qu8TW8BF42]— Scottie Pippen (@ScottiePippen)\n[January 10, 2025]\nThe Dallas Mavericks minority owner mentioned that he believes Bitcoin to be more helpful during times of crisis in the economy. He believes that the cryptocurrency is portable, secure, and has more functional currency as compared to gold. “Gold isn’t based off the supply and demand of jewelry…People look at bitcoin as a better version of gold, and I agree with that,” Cuban said in an interview with Wired.\nAs mentioned before, Pippen had been very much vocal about his support.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nScottie Pippen's Bitcoin faith—visionary insight or risky gamble in today's volatile market?\nHave an interesting take?\nScottie Pippen’s Prediction on Bitcoin\nBack in September, the [Chicago Bulls](https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nba/chicago-bulls//?utm_medium=website&utm_source=website_internal&utm_campaign=web_link_1) legend took to social media to share a dream that he recently had. He claimed that he dreamt about Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto, as many might recall, is the mysterious figure believed to have developed Bitcoin and who has never been seen by anyone. As Pippen shared his story, he claimed that Nakamoto revealed the development of Bitcoin to him in his dream.\n“Satoshi Nakamoto visited me in my dream last night and predicted that #Bitcoin would be at $84,650 on November 5, 2024. Not financial advice,” Pippen wrote on X. [And it quickly made noise](https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-legends-basketball-news-scottie-pippen-and-sicty-six-billion-rich-finance-moguls-satoshi-nakamoto-bizarre-connection-reignites-after-two-months//?utm_medium=website&utm_source=website_internal&utm_campaign=web_link_1).\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nAs per The Guardian, Bitcoin indeed reached the value that Pippen mentioned, leaving several netizens in disbelief. The Chicago Bulls legend seems very confident about Bitcoin on X, so much so that he even compared Bitcoin to the Chicago Bulls. “Bitcoin in 2024 is giving me flashbacks to the Bulls in ’91… a dynasty just starting. Get ready for what’s next,” he once wrote on X. He continues to have the same faith.\nHave something to say?\nLet the world know your perspective.\nChallenge Your Sports Knowledge!\nSolve the puzzle and prove your knowledge of iconic players, terms, and moments.\nDebate\nScottie Pippen's Bitcoin faith—visionary insight or risky gamble in today's volatile market?",
