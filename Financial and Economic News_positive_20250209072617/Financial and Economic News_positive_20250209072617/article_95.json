    "text": "Singapore has claimed the title of the world's most powerful passport in 2025, offering visa-free access to 195 destinations out of 227, according to the Henley Passport Index. This Asian powerhouse has regained its top spot, surpassing competitors across the globe.\nJapan Secures Second Place\nJapan ranks second with visa-free access to 193 destinations, maintaining its position as a strong contender in global mobility.\nEU Nations Slip to Third Place\nEuropean Union (EU) member states France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, which shared the top position in 2024, have now slipped to third place. They join Finland and South Korea, with all six passports allowing visa-free travel to 192 destinations in 2025.\nSeven EU Nations Share Fourth Spot\nAustria, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden occupy the fourth position, each providing visa-free access to 191 destinations.\nThe United Kingdom (UK) and New Zealand Secure Positions in the Top Five\nThe fifth rank is shared by Belgium, Portugal, Switzerland, the UK, and New Zealand. Notably, New Zealand is the only non-European nation in this group. Visa-free access to 190 destinations is granted by these passports. However, the UK has experienced a consistent decline in its passport strength over the past decade, moving further away from its once-dominant position.\nUS Passport Falls to Ninth Place\nThe United States has seen a sharp decline in its ranking, dropping to ninth place. A decade ago, the US passport frequently held the top spots but now offers visa-free travel to 186 destinations.\nIndia's Passport Ranking Declines\nIndia has slipped five places to rank 85th in the 2025 Henley Passport Index. The Indian passport provides visa-free access to 57 countries, sharing its position with Equatorial Guinea and Niger. This drop highlights the need for India to strengthen its global mobility prospects.\nPakistan and Afghanistan Remain at the Bottom\nPakistan is tied at the 103rd position alongside Yemen, with its passport offering visa-free entry to just 33 countries. Iraq follows at 104th with 31 destinations, while Syria ranks 105th with access to 27 destinations. Meanwhile, Afghanistan holds the lowest rank, 106th, with its passport allowing visa-free access to a mere 26 destinations.\nTop 10 Most Powerful Passports in 2025\nHenley Passport Index 2025, most powerful passports, Singapore passport ranking, India passport rank, global mobility, visa-free travel, US passport decline, Afghanistan least powerful passport, travel and mobility, international rankings.",
