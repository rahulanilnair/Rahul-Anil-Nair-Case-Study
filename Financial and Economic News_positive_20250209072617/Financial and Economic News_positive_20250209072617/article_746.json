    "text": "After a sharp correction in consumer stocks, global brokerage firm Nomura believes that these stocks are now at reasonable valuations as it named Marico, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and ITC as its top picks in the sector.Nomura has a ‘buy’ rating on all three stocks with a target price of Rs 760 for Marico, Rs 3,100 for HUL and Rs 575 for ITC.Preferring a bottom-up thesis, the global brokerage firm expects these companies with pricing power, expanding in new categories/markets, and investing in digital capabilities to stand out.Consumer stocks have undergone sharp corrections in recent months due to lower-than-expected demand and continued earning cuts. The sector is now trading at 2-Std Dev below its five-year trading average.“As India’s inflation is likely to moderate and GDP likely to improve, we believe volume growth will improve marginally and price hikes will improve value growth. We see risk-weighted sector valuations at reasonable levels and any relief from the administration on inflation and taxes/rebates to be supportive for the sector,” said Nomura in its report.Nomura further stated that urban demand is expected to remain weak in the first half of 2025 due to a lack of improvement catalysts. However, a cyclical improvement is projected for the second half of the year. Overall, volume growth is anticipated to remain below the long-term average. Any measures taken by the administration to lower inflation and boost disposable incomes, such as tax cuts or rebates, could potentially revitalize urban demand.Also read: Adani Wilmar shares dive 9% as Adani Group plans to sell 20% stake via OFSAdditionally, given the sharp inflation in raw material prices (of palm oil, tea, coffee, cocoa etc), companies have started taking price hikes, although at rates lower than commodity inflation.“We believe companies will continue to take product price hikes in a gradual manner to avoid any volume shock. This should support overall sales value growth in 2025F vs 2024 where companies had cut prices for most part of the year,” said Mihir P. Shah, Analyst at Nomura.The global brokerage firm also noted that the sharp rise in raw material costs will likely reduce competitive intensity from regional/unorganized players as they operate on thin margins and limited working capital, which will make them uncompetitive vs the organized players, who are better equipped to maneuver and also recruit consumers in such times.While current margins for most consumer companies are still below their pre-COVID levels, Nomura expects margin expansion to be limited in 2025F as companies might avoid flexing strong pricing power given the weak consumer demand environment.Hence, most companies are expected to focus on driving volume growth and market share vs prioritising margin expansion.Also read: TCS shares rally 5% after Q3 profit rises 12% YoY.
