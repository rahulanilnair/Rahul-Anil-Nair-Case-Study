According to the latest report, the market is expected to rise at a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.4%, reaching a value of US$ 360.1 million by 2031.

Additionally, brands like Califia Farms are expanding their cold brew offerings to cater to the growing segment of health-conscious consumers opting for plant-based and organic options.\nKey Insights into the Caffeinated Beverage Market\nMarket Size (2024E): US$ 249.6 million\nProjected Market Value (2031F): US$ 360.1 million\nGlobal Market Growth Rate (CAGR 2024 to 2031): 5.4%\nHistorical Market Growth Rate (CAGR 2019 to 2023): 4.3%\nThe market's growth is fueled by several key factors:\nEnergy-Boosting Beverages: Increased demand among young consumers and professionals for beverages that improve energy levels and performance.\nCoffee Culture: The global popularity of coffee and specialty coffee experiences, particularly in urban regions, is driving the consumption of caffeinated drinks.\nProduct Innovation: New product formats, flavors, and functional ingredients in energy drinks and coffee-based beverages are gaining traction.\nAlternative Brewing Technologies: The rise of cold brew, nitro coffee, and other innovative brewing methods are attracting younger consumer demographics.\nNatural flavors are expected to hold the largest market share of 65% in 2024 due to their widespread availability.
