    "text": "Latest news about Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies. Your daily crypto news habit.\nWith the general crypto market under severe pressure,\n[Dogecoin](https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoins-correction-inches-closer-to-an-end/) has declined sharply, reaching as low as $0.327 on Wednesday. Despite the notable downswing in price, DOGE’s potential to surge significantly in the current cycle may still be intact as past trends hint at a persistent bull phase.\nFinal Phase Of Dogecoin’s Bull Run On The Horizon?\nDogecoin may have triggered fear and uncertainty among investors after its latest price drop. However, with positive price trends unfolding, the dog-themed meme coin’s short-term and long-term outlook remains bullish as this cycle progresses.\nFollowing an examination of Dogecoin’s recent price action, Trader Tardigrade, a market expert and investor, has\n[underlined](https://x.com/TATrader_Alan/status/1876955017628021158) an extension of DOGE’s bull phase. In his analysis, the expert has predicted that DOGE’s final bull run could be on the horizon.\nThis forecast, which has attracted attention in the community, aligns with trends during previous cycles, suggesting that its last bull run may be about to begin.\n[Historical trends](https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoins-past-price-action-points-to-a-cycle-top/) show that this movement has preceded strong rallies in the past, triggering speculations about a resurgence in price among investors.\nAs observed in past patterns, the\n[meme coin](https://bitcoinist.com/6-meme-coins-making-waves-this-week/) consolidated for a few months close to its all-time high levels before its last spike in 2017. Meanwhile, a similar trend has emerged in this ongoing cycle as the 1-month chart shows that DOGE is currently consolidating near key levels.\nShould DOGE reiterate the same result, Trader Tardigrade claims that the current consolidation may continue for a few months until the final bull run takes place. As a result, the expert foresees a rally close to the\n[$6 level](https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-bullish-pattern/), marking a new all-time high and a possible market top for DOGE.\nGiven the growing confidence in the market and\n[rising activity](https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whale-activity-400/), crypto enthusiasts are actively monitoring DOGE’s price trajectory as the meme coin rises toward important barriers.\nConsidering ongoing positive developments in price, Trader Tardigrade has urged investors to be steadfast,\n[noting](https://x.com/TATrader_Alan/status/1876900909638365218) that now is not the time to sell or short DOGE. This is because Dogecoin is retesting the apex of the Ascending Triangle formation, reflecting a positive outlook for the meme coin.\nWhen an ascending triangle pattern unfolds, it usually indicates an upside momentum. DOGE’s move to the upper line suggests a potential\n[bullish breakout](https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-breakout-from-a-critical-chart-pattern/) if the price holds above the line in the coming days.\nDOGE’s Next Major Rally Set In 2025\nRecent bearish performance in the general crypto market has triggered a notable decline in DOGE. Despite the drop, KrissPax, a crypto expert,\n[highlighted](https://x.com/krisspax/status/1876998947601838136) that Dogecoin’s price action is quite similar to past trends from a year ago that preceded an upward move.\nKrissPax noted that prior to a significant increase in 2024, the asset moved higher in November 2023, then fell and consolidated. In November 2024,\n[DOGE](https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-price/) also traded higher, then fell, and is currently consolidating. Due to this, the expert anticipates Dogecoin’s next major rally in the coming weeks.\nDisclaimer\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not reflect the views of Bitcoin Insider.
