    "text": "Recent analysis suggests that Ripple’s XRP could be poised for a massive price surge. Top analyst Levi Rietveld shared on X (formerly Twitter) that XRP is forming a bull flag pattern, a technical structure often associated with continued upward momentum.\nPaired with rising open interest and historical bullish trends, this pattern hints at the potential for\n[the price of XRP](https://captainaltcoin.com/ripple-xrp-looks-ready-for-another-short-term-rally-one-resistance-to-go/) to target $15, representing a significant rally of over 500%.\nXRP Chart Analysis: Price Patterns Suggest Bullish Continuation\nThe chart highlights a key breakout moment for\n[XRP](https://captainaltcoin.com/ripple-xrp-price-prediction/), where its price surged from below $1 to over $2.50 in November. This rally was accompanied by a notable increase in trading volume, indicating strong market participation. Following the breakout, the XRP price entered a consolidation phase, signaling potential accumulation before another upward movement.\nKey support levels include $0.50, where\n[XRP’s price](https://captainaltcoin.com/expert-makes-urgent-xrp-price-update-what-to-watch/) consolidated pre-rally, and $1.34, which aligns with recent consolidation activity. Resistance was observed near $2.50 and slightly below $3, where the price briefly struggled to sustain upward momentum. These levels remain critical as XRP eyes further gains.\nBull Flag Formation and XRP Price Target Projection\nThe chart also focuses on the bull flag pattern identified by Rietveld. The price shot up from $0.50 to $2.40, going up almost 5 times. This created a flag pattern, which usually means prices will keep rising. Based on this pattern, we’re looking at possible prices between $12.42 and $14.80.\nLooking at the moving averages, XRP’s price is still riding high above all the important ones – the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day. This tells us buyers are still in control. Meanwhile, RSI levels, hovering around neutral to slightly bullish zones, suggest there is room for further upward momentum without entering overbought territory.\nRead Also:\n[5 Under-the-Radar Altcoins Ready to Outshine SUI and XRP in 2025](https://captainaltcoin.com/5-under-the-radar-altcoins-ready-to-outshine-sui-and-xrp-in-2025/)\nRising Open Interest and Historical Momentum Support Bullish Case\nRietveld emphasized rising open interest in XRP markets, signaling increased participation and trader confidence. Historical data also highlights XRP’s tendency to experience sharp upward rallies during bullish cycles, aligning with the current analysis.\nTo validate this outlook,\n[XRP’s price](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/) must break above the $2.90 resistance level. If successful, the cryptocurrency could initiate the next phase of its rally, potentially reaching the anticipated $15 target.\nFollow us on\n[X (Twitter)](https://x.com/CaptainAltcoin_), [CoinMarketCap ](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/CaptainAltcoin/)and [Binance Square](https://www.binance.com/en/square/profile/captainaltcoin) for more daily crypto updates.\nGet all our future calls by joining our\n[FREE Telegram group.](https://t.me/captainaltcoincom)\n[\nWe recommend eToro\n](https://captainaltcoin.com/go/etoro/)\n[Take 2 mins to learn more](https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/terms-conditions/trading-restriction/)\nWide range of assets: cryptocurrencies alongside other investment products such as stocks and ETFs.\nCopy trading: allows users to copy the trades of leading traders, for free.\nUser-friendly: eToro’s web-based platform and mobile app are user-friendly and easy to navigate.",
