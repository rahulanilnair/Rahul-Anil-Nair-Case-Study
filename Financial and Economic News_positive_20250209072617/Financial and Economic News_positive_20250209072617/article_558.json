These include inflation, geopolitical uncertainties and trade tensions,\" he cautioned.\nMeanwhile, total global passenger demand, measured in revenue passenger kilometres, was up 8.1pct in November 2024 compared to the same month in 2023, IATA said.\nTotal capacity, measured in available seat kilometres, increased 5.7pct year-on-year (y-o-y), while the November load factor was 83.4pct, up 1.9 percentage points (ppt) from a year earlier, it said.\nIATA said international demand rose 11.6pct compared to Nov 2023. Capacity was up 8.6pct y-o-y, and the load factor rose 2.3 ppt to 83.4pct compared to the same period in 2023.\nMeanwhile, domestic demand grew 3.1pct y-o-y. Capacity was up 1.5pct y-o-y, and the load factor was 1.2 ppt higher at 83.5pct compared to Nov 2023, IATA said.â€“ BERNAMA\n - Bernama",
