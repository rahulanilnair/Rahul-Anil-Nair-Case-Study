The results were presented at the 2024 Tandem Meeting of ASTCT and CIBMTR.\n.The only FDA-approved therapies for treating GvHD are ORENCIA (abatacept), JAKAFI/JAKAVI (ruxolitinib), IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib), and REZUROCK (belumosudil).\n.In 2023, there were approximately 25,000 hematopoietic stem-cell transplant cases and around 10,500 allogenic transplant cases in the US.\n.In 2023, the US had the largest Graft vs. Host Disease population, making up about 45% of the total in the 7MM. Japan contributed around 16%, while Germany accounted for approximately 15% of the population share.\n.Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) severity is categorized as mild, moderate, or severe based on the number and severity of affected organs. About 45% of the five-year prevalent cases of this chronic condition are classified as moderate.\n.Key Graft-Versus-Host Disease Companies: CSL Behring, Equillium, Biocon, MaaT Pharma, Regimmune, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Pharmacyclics LLC., Novartis, Biogen, Mallinckrodt, Astellas Pharma, Mesoblast, Inc., Thrasher Research Fund, Regimmune Corporation, Syndax Pharmaceutical, Novartis, and others\n.Key Graft-Versus-Host Disease Therapies: ZEMAIRA (CSL 964, alpha-1 antitrypsin), EQ001 (itolizumab; Bmab600), MaaT013, RGI-2001, Defibrotide, Ibrutinib, Panobinostat (LBH589), Natalizumab, Methoxsalen, Prograf, Prochymal®, Abatacept, RGI-2001, Axatilimab, Ruxolitinib, and others\n.In the United States in 2022, roughly 4,780 cases of acute Graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) and approximately 17,210 cases of chronic Graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) received first-line treatment. Projections suggest an anticipated increase in these cases by the year 2034.\n.The Graft-Versus-Host Disease market is expected to surge due to the disease's increasing prevalence and awareness during the forecast period. Furthermore, launching various multiple-stage Graft-Versus-Host Disease pipeline products will significantly revolutionize the Graft-Versus-Host Disease market dynamics.\nGraft-Versus-Host Disease Overview\nGraft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) is a condition that occurs after a bone marrow or stem cell transplant in which the donated (graft) immune cells attack the recipient's (host) body tissues. This reaction happens because the donor's immune cells recognize the recipient's cells as foreign and initiate an immune response against them.\nGet a Free sample for the Graft-Versus-Host Disease Market Forecast, Size & Share Analysis Report:\nGraft-Versus-Host Disease Epidemiology\nThe epidemiology section provides insights into the historical, current, and forecasted epidemiology trends in the seven major countries (7MM) from 2020 to 2034.
