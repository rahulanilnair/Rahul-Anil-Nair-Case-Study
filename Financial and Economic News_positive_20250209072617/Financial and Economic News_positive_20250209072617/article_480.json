    "text": "So, a kind of buyer's fatigue and a bit of a problem with the macro will combine to keep the market somewhat subdued if not go down further from here, that is where I would think the overall picture is, says Anand Tandon, Independent Analyst.What is your take on the markets because the trend right now is definitely on the weaker side, even today there has been no substantial recovery? So overall, how do you see the construct of the market and what are the factors that are playing heavy on the markets right now?Anand Tandon: Most of the macro factors right now are not suiting the market. We are clearly in a situation where the expectation that interest rates will fall is slowly receding. Given where we are with the US yield curve, it is unlikely that the RBI can actually go ahead and cut interest rates dramatically from here without expecting to see a further sharp fall in the rupee and that can be quite problematic. The macro overall, while the deficit at the central level looks good, the state level is not anything great to be talking about and there is a clear slowdown that is evident in terms of consumption in most of the other sectors. Given where the valuations stand, therefore, there is no great reason for anybody to be buying it other than the euphoria which we saw most of last year. But I think now slightly a somewhat more realistic picture is emerging. Despite that, if you see other than the commodity stocks, most of the stocks are trading at 60 to 90 times forward earnings which is hardly the place that you would want to buy. So, a kind of buyer's fatigue and a bit of a problem with the macro will combine to keep the market somewhat subdued if not go down further from here, that is where I would think the overall picture is. What is the sense on real estate? Has it peaked out both in terms of cycle as well as stock price?Anand Tandon: I would hesitate to say that it has peaked out, but it is not as if it is very early in the cycle. It is a very mature cycle that you see right now. It will probably last another six months, one year, maybe one-and-a-half years in most of the cases. Each city is different. It is a very localised business. But to a large extent, given where the prices are today, after a sharp increase in price and a sharp increase in sales, it is very likely that you will hit some kind of a slowing down effect from here on. More importantly if the stock market itself were to correct, slowing down of the wealth creation will also affect a slowing down of the asset creation in real estate. So, are you likely to see one more year of good earnings? I would hazard a guess that yes, it will be. Most of the companies will be reporting fairly decent numbers for the next 12 months. But from a stock market point of view, not necessarily a huge upside from here. Also, help us with some of the sectors that you are eyeing at this point in time and those look good given the market correction.Anand Tandon: Like I said really, I am looking for defensive sectors rather than those which are aggressively growing because most of the growth in my view will now start to taper off. So, sectors that have not done well are the ones you are likely to be finding better places to be in. For example, the banking, the insurance sector are two areas which have not performed all that well, is something that you might want to look at. From a consumption perspective, the good old staples is something that one can be looking at. You are betting on a better rural recovery and therefore more money in the hands of the consumer in the rural area. So, all the traditional FMCG and staples companies have a good runway ahead. Some of them even have international markets where things are looking up, for example, Godrej. So, some of these companies are something that you might want to look at. And then there are, of course, individual plays that you could always find which are difficult to classify in the sectoral thing. The broader themes that you are looking for in the market continue to remain things like data centres and new technology. But to my mind, it is very difficult to find companies in India which are reasonably priced and have that kind of growth. For most of the other growth sectors, like for example, EMS and so on, I think the valuations are kind of stretched for the numbers that will undoubtedly come through. Would you want to bet on defence names and buy a fresh?Anand Tandon: There are various kinds of defence companies. By and large, if you take something like HAL, for example, they can make the body, but they cannot make the engines and we know the story of what is happening with the engines. Nothing has been delivered over the last one-and-a-half years as far as the new machines are concerned. As a consequence, despite the fact that they have an order book, they are not able to deliver on it and yet the stocks have rallied to a level where the valuations are more than many of their international peers. So, yes, there is no question that the underlying theme in terms of defence spending will remain strong. The challenge remains that you need to get more private sector players into it and also that you need to move away from just platforms to things which are a little more agile. I mean, today, a drone and cyber security is far more important necessarily than just going on and making a lot more tanks or artillery, for example. So, to the extent that the order books are fairly robust, the companies will have to and have the ability to manufacture it locally, you should expect to see earnings growth. But you have to remember that even today, private sector players are seriously constrained in terms of being able to access the defence market and until that substantially changes, you will unlikely see too many new startups or innovators coming into the market to deliver. So, it remains a very strong theme, except that India is not the best market to be playing it. You should be looking at investing in the US.",
