    "text": "The Chairman, Ifako-Ijaiye Local Government Area of Lagos State, Usman Hamzat, has approved a N20,000 monthly palliative for members of staff of the council from January 2025.\nHamzat, while giving his remarks at the Thanksgiving and Staff Recognition Ceremony on Thursday at the council Secretariat, appreciated the workers for their unwavering support for remarkable achievements in the previous years.\nThe News Agency of Nigeria reports that the chairman noted that several new initiatives were in line aimed at motivating workers and driving growth within the local government area.\n“A new staff bus will be officially presented to the staff to ease transportation challenges and reduce expenses.\n“Also, each staff member will receive an additional N20,000 monthly as palliative support for the next three months, with the possibility of an extension.\n“We are always emphasising our commitment to staff welfare and reward initiative as outlined in our H.E.E.D.S Agenda, for a greater Ifako-Ijaiye,” he said.\nThe chairman also gave N5m to the revenue team to further encourage and accelerate the growing revenue generation.\nHe added that the gesture was a fulfillment of his earlier promise to reward the team if the Internally Generated Revenue improved by the end of 2024, a goal that was successfully achieved.\nHamzat also recognised outstanding employees with cash rewards, washing machines, and other valuable items worth millions of naira.",
