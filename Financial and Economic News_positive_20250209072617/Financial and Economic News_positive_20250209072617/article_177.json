You may find his writing a little different than other stock articles you’ve read. And that’s OK with him. Chris doesn’t have a traditional finance background. What he does bring to the table is a strong business and marketing background having worked for agencies that serviced Fortune 500 companies. With that in mind, he isn’t overly impressed with what companies say, and more focused on what they do. And because buyer behavior dictates so much of what happens with a stock, Chris always keeps the end consumer close in mind. Chris has been writing for MarketBeat since 2018.\nSubscribe on YouTube Don't Miss a Video Subscribe to watch the latest stock market videos from MarketBeat.\nWe empower investors to make better trading decisions by providing real-time financial data and objective market analysis.\nSubscribe on YouTube",
