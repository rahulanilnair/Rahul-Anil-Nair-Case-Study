    "text": "Cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez pointed out in his latest statement that there are two potential critical points in the XRP price and additionally evaluated Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nAccording to Martinez, the first of the critical points is the $2.05 level, which is the rising trend line of the pennant formation. As the second critical level, the analyst indicated the $2.50 level, which represents an exit point from the pennant version.\nAt the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at $2.30.\nHowever, Martinez claimed that his price target for XRP is $10, regardless of critical price levels.\n[Related News What's Next for Bitcoin Price? Analytics Firm Presents Two Bullish, One Bearish Scenarios](https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-next-for-bitcoin-price-analytics-firm-presents-two-bullish-one-bearish-scenarios/)\nAli Martinez also made some comments about Bitcoin. According to the analyst, currently 66.38% of traders on Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, predict that the BTC price will bounce again.\nFinally, speaking about Ethereum, the analyst argued that a drop to $2,900 for the ETH price could be a very bullish development. According to the analyst, this could be a step towards the next target of $7,000.\n*This is not investment advice.",
