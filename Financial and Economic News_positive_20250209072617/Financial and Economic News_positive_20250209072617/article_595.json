Photograph courtesy of Sinulog Foundation Rico Osmeña Published on: 10 Jan 2025, 03:43\nCopied\nThe Cebu City government has released P38 million in subsidies for the 42 contingents participating in the Sinulog Grand Parade and Ritual Showdown.\nThe release was led by Mayor Raymond Alvin Garcia on Wednesday, 8 January, to representatives of the contingents, who will join the Sinulog Grand Parade and Showdown on 19 January at the Cebu City Sports Center (CCSC).\nEighteen contingents based in Cebu City received P500,000 each, while 21 out-of-town contingents received P1.5 million each, including those from the cities of Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu.\nIn previous Sinulog events, contingents had to reimburse their expenses due to late release of the subsidy.\nThe contingents will perform on 19 January along the traditional carousel-type route for the street dancing, while the grand ritual showdown will take place at CCSC.\nThe route will span at least six kilometers, starting at the intersection of General Maxilom Avenue and Imus Avenue, then proceeding to Fuente Osmena Circle, turning left onto Osmena Boulevard, continuing to CCSC, and returning to P. Del Rosario Street.\nCebu City contingents Sinulog Grand Parade Sinulog 2025",
