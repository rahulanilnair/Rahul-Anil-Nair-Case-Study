    "text": "One of my favorite things is talking to people, especially young professionals who are chasing their dreams. You see, I was once just like them: someone with ambition, drive, and energy, but no roadmap to get me where I wanted to go. Since those early days, I have learned how important it is to find mentors who will give you good advice along the way, especially if you belong to an underrepresented group.\nAs a Black leader, I’ve faced many of the obstacles inherent in contemporary American society. I went from a manager’s role at Dollar General to CEO of the technology company I-Cubed by the time I was 36 years old. I benefited from caring, tough-minded mentors along the way, many who saw my potential and helped me learn what I needed to succeed. Today, I coach C-suite executives, sit on the boards of multiple organizations, and nurture high-performing, high-potential professionals in my network.\nThese aspiring entrepreneurs and young business leaders already know how tricky it is to navigate the business world, but winners don’t waste time thinking about the obstacles. Sure, you have to be aware of potential challenges, but you can’t let those hold you back. Instead of focusing on what stands between you and your goals, concentrate on your strengths and draw confidence from what only you can bring to the table.\nOnce you have this winning mindset, you can take practical actions to get you where you want to go. Think of these tips as a roadmap to help guide you on your professional path.\n1. Network with purpose: My favorite piece of advice is to contact someone you admire and ask if you can buy them a cup of coffee. Most business leaders will agree, because they will see themselves in you. It doesn’t matter what you look like, your age, or your ethnicity; most leaders will recognize the same desire for excellence that drives them. These short conversations over coffee will give you priceless business insights for a relatively modest investment.\nPersonal\nconnections are especially important for underrepresented entrepreneurs, who\nhave less [ready access to venture capital](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/technology/black-founders).\nAsking [friends and family for financial support](https://fortune.com/2021/09/15/black-entrepreneurs-inequality-funding-pre-seed-round/) is often one of the first steps to launching a business,\nyet Black founders typically can’t take advantage of familial wealth. The more\nyou can get to know powerful business leaders along the way, the greater the\nchance they’ll invest in your idea or introduce you to people who can support\nyou.\n2. Cut your debt: Getting your personal finances in order might not sound like career advice, but the math proves my point. The more financial obligations you have, the fewer your choices. The smaller your expenses, the greater your choices and your ability to chase opportunities. For example, if you are burdened with debt, you might stay in a steady but unfulfilling job to pay the bills. But if you have no debt and six months’ – or a year’s – worth of expenses saved up, your dream of starting your own business suddenly gets a little more real.\nFor underrepresented entrepreneurs, having a solid financial foundation is especially important. Lack of capital can be a huge barrier, but not for those who can invest their own money. Launching a business is also easier if you don’t have to immediately depend on it to pay your bills.\n3. Build a solid team: As\nyou are networking, you should also look for people who have skills you don’t\nhave. [Diverse teams](https://thediversitymovement.com/power-of-teamwork-diverse-teams-drive-stronger-growth/) lead to\nbetter outcomes. It’s no different when cultivating your circle of trust. Find\npeople who can provide different perspectives and alert you to opportunities\nyou might not be aware of. When you expand your network with this strategic\nmindset, you can create relationships of mutual aid that can grow and flourish\nover time.\nRecruiting people with different skills – whether as advisers or colleagues – is especially important for small business owners. Founders can’t do everything, and when you find people with the expertise you lack, you are free to concentrate on your strengths.\n4. Ask for feedback: Many people would prefer not to hear brutally honest feedback, but young business professionals need to embrace this process. In order to grow as a leader, you need to understand how you are perceived by others and know where you can improve. Ask colleagues, mentors or trusted friends for their critiques, and most will be generous with their advice and help identifying areas of improvement. Not only will you improve personally, but leaders who learn to receive feedback have a greater understanding of how to give effective feedback.\nIf you’re an entrepreneur, feedback is even more vital. Pitch your idea to 10 people and ask for their honest opinion. Because you need an accurate reading of your idea’s strength and commercial viability, avoid asking friends and family who are likely to sugarcoat answers. Instead, seek advice from industry experts and other professionals. Then, tell 100 people about your idea, and you’ll start to understand how your product or business needs to evolve in order to survive in the market.\n5. Get to market quickly: Many entrepreneurs are creative thinkers who can quickly innovate and come up with new concepts. What separates those with big ideas and those with successful companies is the ability to move from concept, to market, to sales as fast as possible. Because underrepresented founders usually have less capital at their disposal, it’s vital to generate income that will fuel growth.\nWhile this last piece of advice might seem like it’s just for entrepreneurs, it also works for budding business leaders. Let me rephrase my advice for clarity: Don’t be afraid to take measured risks. Your product or your resume will never be 100% perfect, and that’s okay. If you’re an entrepreneur, launch anyway and figure it out as you go. If you’re looking to advance in an organization, ask for the stretch assignments, knowing that you might make some mistakes – and learn from them.\nI know that not everyone can afford an executive coach, especially when they are beginning their professional journey. But even young professionals can think strategically about their career, be mindful of their goals, and look for opportunities to learn and grow. Everything you learn and everyone you connect with will feed your confidence and concentrate your focus on the unique qualities that only you can bring to the marketplace. I’m proof that underrepresented and underestimated leaders and entrepreneurs can find a path to success.
