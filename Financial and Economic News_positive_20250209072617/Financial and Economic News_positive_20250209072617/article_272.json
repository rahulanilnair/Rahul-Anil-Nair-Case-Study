    "text": "AARP Eye Center\nA recent survey conducted by AARP ElderWatch found that 73% of Colorado adults are very worried about scams and fraud.\nWith this being the start of 2025, why not make it one of your resolutions to recognize, refuse and report fraud?! While scams can take various forms, there are often “red flags” that are common to many scams. Recognizing red flags will help you avoid most scams. The following are some common red flags that may help you identify if a scammer is trying to steal your money or personal information:\n• You are asked to send payment in a non-traditional method, such as via pre-paid gift card, wire transfer, crypto-currency or peer-to-peer payment app\n• You receive unsolicited contact from a government agency, business or other entity that is unexpected and unprofessional\n• You are requested to provide or verify critical information such as a bank account number, health information or your Social Security number\n• The request is urgent in nature, often with a timeline to ensure there is not time to verify its legitimacy\n• The offer seems “too good to be true” or not in line with market value for the product or service\n• There is little or no contact information for the organization and third-party reviews are limited or don’t exist\nAside from recognizing red flags, one of the best ways to stay scam free is to “trust your gut,” if something doesn’t sound right, don’t go along with it. If you have a question about a fraud or potential scam contact an AARP ElderWatch volunteer specialist for information and assistance. Stay Scam Free in 2025!\nConcerned about fraud or a scam?
