The companies argue that the 28% tax rate applies only from October 1, whereas the government contends that the October 1 revision merely clarified a law already in force. The government's stance is that the demand for tax dues is not retrospective in nature.\nIn August 2023, the GST Council amended the law to state that all online games involving bets, regardless of skill or chance, would attract a 28% GST on the full value of the bets placed, starting October 1.\nFollowing this decision, online gaming companies have faced significant tax demands, which experts warn could potentially devastate the industry.\nAlso Read: FIIs begin 2025 with $2 billion selloff in 7 days. 6 reasons driving the exodus\nDelta Corp technical indicators Technically, the stock's relative strength index (RSI) is at 46.7.
