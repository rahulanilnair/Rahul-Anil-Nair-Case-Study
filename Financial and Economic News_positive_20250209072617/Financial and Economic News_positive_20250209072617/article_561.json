    "text": "By Jade Leah Burns ,\n4 hours ago\nCalling all small business owners and entrepreneurs!\nThe City of Erie has opened its latest round of Flagship grants financial assistance.\nThis program can assist businesses with a wide variety of needs and will now continue to transform and make a difference for small business owners.\nThe City of Erie’s administration has been investing in small businesses since 2018 giving away more than $300,000.\nMayor Schember offers update on city’s LERTA program Officials announced that they are continuing this trend by opening their Flagship Funds micro-grant program to applicants starting Thursday, Jan. 9.\nAccording to the director of office development, it’s designed to provide financial assistance to support market-ready products and services while also serving to enhance the city’s reputation for innovation and creativity.\n“A lot of the economic development programs are geared towards larger projects, there’s not a lot out there for small business so we wanted to make sure we had something that could assist small business directly,” said Chris Groner, director for the City of Erie’s Office of Development.\nClose Thanks for signing up!\nWatch for us in your inbox.\nSubscribe Now\nDaily News All you have to do is be a registered business with an address in the City of Erie.\nGroner said they prefer businesses with 25 employees or less.\nThose who apply can get up to $5,000 with a one-to-one match requirement.\n“Usually businesses match it more than one to one so that’s a good sign. That means investments coming into the city, but it’s going to the small business,” Groner added.\nWith the PACT Act expanded, what does that mean for Erie veterans? One business owner who’s a two-time recipient said not only did these funds help her to open but it allowed for improvements along the way.\n“It helped with the equipment in the space that you see and the other increment was for marketing, trying to get the word out in the Erie community about Purrista,” said Dena Rupp, owner of Purrista Cat Cafe. “It’s not an opportunity that comes along all the time, and we struggle too sometimes, we need a little bit of help.”\nRupp brought this fresh idea to the area that’s popular in larger cities such as Pittsburgh and Cleveland.\nThe cat cafe is located at 30 West Eighth St. and will be celebrating three years this February. They host up to 15 adoptable cats from Because You Care animal rescue.\nErie City Council unanimously passes two-page version of Tenant Bill of Rights Rupp said they have had 295 cats rescued and adopted since they opened.\n“We’re all trying to do the best we can. Small businesses are such a huge part of this community. It makes Erie unique and I think they are a very huge part of what’s important here in Erie,” Rupp explained.\nThe application deadline is Jan. 31.
