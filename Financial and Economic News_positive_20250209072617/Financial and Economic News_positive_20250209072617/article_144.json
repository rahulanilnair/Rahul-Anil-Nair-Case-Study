    "text": "Evotec SE's stock has shown remarkable resilience in recent market trading, posting a significant upturn of 3.8% to reach €8.66 on XETRA. This positive movement marks a notable recovery from the stock's dramatic downturn to its 52-week low of €5.06 in August 2024, though it remains substantially below its January peak of €18.61. The increased trading volume, exceeding 217,000 shares, reflects heightened investor interest despite the stock's volatile performance throughout the year. The biotechnology company's third-quarter results revealed challenging operational metrics, with revenue declining by 5.8% to €184.89 million compared to the previous year.\nFinancial Outlook and Market Expectations\nAnalysts maintain a cautiously optimistic stance on Evotec's future prospects, setting an average price target of €9.68. However, the company's financial trajectory shows continued pressure, with earnings per share registering a loss of €0.22 in the third quarter. Market experts project these challenges to persist, forecasting a loss per share of €0.776 for the full fiscal year 2024. The company's decision to withhold dividend payments for both the current and previous fiscal years further underscores its ongoing financial constraints.\nAd\nEvotec Stock: New Analysis - 10 January\nFresh Evotec information released.
