In 2024, the firm successfully completed approximately 200 engagements for more than 100 clients, with around two-thirds of the business being from clients that have engaged the firm in prior years.\nRepresentative engagements:\n- Provided numerous M&A advisory support engagements to many of the world’s leading private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds, and other aviation industry investors for transactions involving aircraft lessors, passenger and cargo airlines, aerospace suppliers, MROs, ground handling businesses, and other service providers\n- Served as aviation industry advisor to the unsecured creditors in connection with the Chapter 11 restructuring of major European and South American airlines\n- Provided fleet planning and related advisory services to airlines in Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, and the Middle East\n- Successfully led the strategic sourcing for a fleet of new narrowbody aircraft through the aircraft leasing channel, along with a long-term engine maintenance services agreement\n- Performed buy-side advisory support on aircraft and engine leasing transactions valued in excess of US$7 billion\n- Continued our multi-year role as the trusted strategic advisor to a leading Middle Eastern MRO supplier, achieving a 35% increase in productivity and the quadrupling of annual revenues (within the same hangar facility footprint)\n- Advised investors, new market entrants, and existing aviation industry players on strategic matters across the BGA industry value chain, including FBOs, aircraft management, charter providers, MROs, trip support, and other players\n- Provided strategic counsel to a number of the world’s largest and best-regarded airports, and also to investors in complex airport transactions\n- Continued a long-term engagement with a diversified energy company to develop and execute its aviation fuel supply chain growth strategy\nAdam Cowburn, Managing Director, says: “2024 served to further validate Alton’s value proposition for serving our clients – deep aviation industry domain expertise paired with strong in-region market insights efficiently delivered to meet challenging transaction and strategic project deadlines.\n“Moving forward in 2025, we anticipate a more favorable economic environment for M&A transactions which should provide additional opportunities to demonstrate Alton’s unique capabilities to our discerning clientele.”\nJohn Mowry, Managing Director, adds: “As the on-going aviation supply chain challenges continue to negatively impact industry stakeholders, Alton has been pleased with the positive feedback received from the growing number of new clients that have benefited from the unparalleled experience of Alton’s professional team of advisors.\n“Our unwavering focus to provide the highest quality advisory support and best-in-class client service positions the firm very well for continued growth in 2025 and beyond.”\nIn 2024, Alton continued to make a positive impact on global and local communities through its commitment to Pledge 1%, the philanthropic movement in which the firm donates 1% of its revenue and volunteers 1% of its time. The firm remains a platinum-level sponsor of Airlink Inc., which continues to respond to areas hit by natural disasters and humanitarian crises in global conflict zones.\nAdditionally, Alton became a gold-level sponsor of the ISTAT Foundation which supports individuals and institutions that promote the advancement of commercial aviation and humanitarianism through scholarships, internships, grants, and education. Furthermore, Alton’s employees selected and volunteered their personal time to numerous charitable organizations in the communities in which they live, in addition to providing substantial financial contributions.",
