Analyst [Chloe Lemaire](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/chloe-lemaire?utm_source=markets.businessinsider.com&utm_medium=referral) from Jefferies maintained a Buy rating on the stock and has a €170.00 price target.\nStay Ahead of the Market:\n- Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with\n[Top Smart Score Stocks](https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks?utm_source=markets.businessinsider.com&utm_medium=referral) - Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using\n[Tipranks' Stock Screener](https://www.tipranks.com/screener/stocks?utm_source=markets.businessinsider.com&utm_medium=referral)\nChloe Lemaire’s rating is based on several positive factors reflecting Airbus Group SE’s performance and prospects. The company reported December deliveries of 123 aircraft, marking a 10% increase year-over-year, which suggests a strong finish to the fourth quarter. Despite missing the full-year delivery target of 770 slightly, the results align with expectations reported by Reuters, showcasing a robust product mix, particularly with the notable increase in A321 deliveries.\nAdditionally, while gross orders were softer than usual in December, the reduction in inventory levels is expected to contribute positively to the company’s free cash flow in the fourth quarter. The combination of increased deliveries, a solid product mix, and improved inventory management underpins the optimistic outlook and supports the Buy rating for Airbus Group SE.\nTipRanks tracks over 100,000 company insiders, identifying the select few who excel in timing their transactions.
