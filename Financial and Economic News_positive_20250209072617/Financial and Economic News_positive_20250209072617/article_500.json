    "text": "To celebrate Women’s World Banking’s 45th anniversary, we are showcasing the voices of individuals from around the world who have shaped and touched Women’s World Banking journey since its inception in 1979 at Commission on the Status of Women to today!\nThese are stories from across Women’s World Banking’s reach from the women we serve and our customers, to allies and women in leadership who have contributed to women’s economic empowerment and financial inclusion.\nEmpowering Women Through Shariah Finance: Anna Setyawati’s Journey of Inclusion\nWhen we think about advancing women’s financial inclusion, the journey often starts with leaders who see beyond barriers and focus on the potential of inclusive systems. Anna Setyawati, Deputy Director of the Shariah Economic and Financial Department at Central Bank of Indonesia, exemplifies this vision. With over two decades of experience, Anna has dedicated her career to empowering women in the financial sector, leveraging innovative approaches to create tangible change.\nLearning to Lead: The LDR Training Experience\nIn a pivotal moment of her career, Anna attended the Leadership and Diversity Program for Regulators by Women’s World Banking. The program aligned with her department’s goals, equipping her with tools to promote women’s financial inclusion, through shariah finance. This includes empowering women shariah entrepreneurs to drive inclusive economic growth through initiatives that improve their access to finance, expand market opportunities, and build their capacity. Notably, Indonesia is ranked third in the world in the development of the Islamic economy according to the 2023 State of the Global Islamic Economy (SGIE) Report.\nAnna says that “the training material was very appropriate and relevant to the programs we were running. Meeting regulators from around the world allowed us to exchange ideas and strategies, especially on advancing women’s financial inclusion.”\nOne of the standout components of the training was its focus on negotiation skills—a critical tool for engaging stakeholders and enhancing the capacities of women-led micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). For Anna, the training was a turning point in how she approached her work with women’s communities.\nThe Power of Storytelling\nAmong the many lessons learned, storytelling stood out as another particularly effective tool. “We were taught how to use storytelling when sharing something. It helps convince partners more effectively to achieve our common goals.”\nThis approach has allowed Anna to connect with diverse audiences, from policymakers to grassroots entrepreneurs. Through compelling narratives, she bridges the gap between policy-level initiatives and the lived realities of women striving to grow their businesses.\nAligning Shariah Values to Create Impact\nAnna champions the alignment between Shariah-based economic principles and the mission of Women’s World Banking. Both frameworks emphasize equality, ensuring women have the same opportunities as men to enhance their capacities and access financial services.\nThrough her years of experience Anna says “I’ve been with Bank Indonesia for over 20 years, but I don’t see this as the pinnacle of my career. What brings me joy is seeing women’s communities become economically empowered.”\nFor Anna, the true reward lies in moments of impact – when a woman entrepreneur tells her that she’s successfully secured financing or expanded her business.\nAnna’s journey exemplifies what it means to lead with purpose. Her unwavering commitment to advancing financial inclusion has not only empowered thousands of women but has also set a benchmark for transformative leadership. In her work, Anna reminds us that inclusive finance is not just a goal but a necessity for creating equitable and thriving economies.\nIn closing of her feature, Ibu Anna calls us all to “make finance work for women.”\nWomen’s World Banking is dedicated to economic empowerment through financial inclusion for the nearly one billion women in the world with no or limited access to formal financial services. Using our sophisticated market and consumer research, we turn insights into real action to design and advocate for policy engagement, digital financial solutions, workplace leadership programs, and gender lens investing.\nAs part of our current strategy, we’ve helped provide 82 million women in emerging markets – targeting 100 million by 2027 – access and use of financial products and services that are transforming women’s lives, households, businesses and communities, and driving inclusive growth globally.\nHelp us reach the nearly billion women still excluded from the formal financial system.
