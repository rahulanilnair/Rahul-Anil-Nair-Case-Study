We will help you find a place or do our best to help you find a place to rent.”\n“Real estate agents need to come together and work hard for the community,” the TV personality noted. “This is our time to be able to give back, so reach out to us.”\nJerod Harris/Getty\nPolly Brindle and Jason Oppenheim in May 2024 Several of Oppenheim’s costars and brokers commented on his video, also extending their support.\nLos Angeles agents Davina Potratz and Mary Bonnet commented, “Yes, ready to serve 🙏💯❤️,” and “❤️❤️❤️❤️,” respectively.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Orange County agents also offered their help. “We are ready to help down in OC! ❤️,” wrote Polly Brindle . “love this 👏❤️,” added Alexandra Jarvis .\nRelated: Celebrity Hairstylist Jen Atkin Shares Loss of L.A.
