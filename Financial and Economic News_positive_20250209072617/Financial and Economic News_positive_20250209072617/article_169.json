    "text": "By Emma McCorkindale ,\n5 hours ago\nHOLBROOK, Mass. (WWLP) – A Massachusetts woman became the third $1 million prize winner in the Massachusetts State Lottery’s new Celtics Banner 18 instant ticket game.\nFarm animals available for free adoption at Nevins Farm this weekend Nancy Hurley-Shannon of Holbrook chose the cash option on her prize and received a one-time payment of $650,000, before taxes. Hurley-Shannon plans on putting the winnings towards her home and retirement.\nThe ticket was purchased at Convenience Mart on South Franklin Street in Holbrook, which will receive a $10,000 bonus for the sale of the winning ticket.\nThe Celtics-themed game launched on November 19 and includes three remaining $1 million grand prizes and offers a second-chance drawing for non-winning tickets, allowing participants to win Celtics merchandise and experiences. Among the second-chance prizes is the Banner 18 Challenge, where one winner will be guaranteed $1 million.\nAfter all of the drawings, the winners will be invited to attend a Celtics home game and participate in the Banner 18 Challenge on the parquet floor at halftime. Additional second chance drawing prizes include Celtics suite and all access experiences, game tickets,\ncustom jerseys, and Celtics prize packs.\nThis is the Massachusetts State Lottery’s fifth Celtic-branded offering since 2009 and the first one since 2012.\nLocal News Headlines Four New York suspects arrested for allegedly shoplifting in Enfield MassDOT warning drivers of EZDriveMA text message scheme Big Y begins annual Paczki sales this week Montague Police Lt.
