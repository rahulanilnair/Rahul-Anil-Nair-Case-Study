    "text": "Pre-tax profits surge by 45pc to €19m at Ardmac Group\nPre-tax profits at data centre-builder the Ardmac Group increased by 45pc to €19.1m in 2023.\nThe Dublin-based group increased its profits after revenues surged by 18pc from €195.29m to €230.63m.\nThe impressive performance by the firm in 2023 persuaded global industrial group Purever Industries to move last July to purchase Ardmac for an undisclosed sum.\nHeadquartered in Portugal, Purever has operations in seven countries, primarily across Europe and the US, and posted revenues of €222m in 2023.\nIn the 2023 annual accounts, the directors for Ardmac state that “the group is well-placed to continue to deliver strong performance in its core markets in Ireland”.\n“This reflects the robust underlying activity levels in the various specialist sectors in which the group operates. In particular the group continues to maintain a strong position in the life sciences, microelectronics and pharmaceutical sectors,” the directors state.\nThe main activity of the company is the design and construction of high-value interior working environments for the life sciences, microelectronics, technology and commercial sectors.\nThe group continues to “expand its activities in the pharmaceutical and data centre sectors” in the UK and mainland Europe which have continued to record good levels of growth in the year, the directors note.\nThe group has secured strong orders for 2024 spread across both the market sectors and geographic locations within which it operates.\nThe directors declared a €5m dividend for 2023 and this followed a €5.4m dividend declared for the prior year.\nNumbers employed increased from 596 to 715 and staff costs rose from €42.3m to €50.8m.\nThe group recorded a post-tax profit of €16.43m after incurring a corporation tax charge of €2.68m.\nThe group’s clients include Pfizer, Roche, Nissan, Novartis, MSD, Unilever and Rohan Holdings.\nThe Irish business last year accounted for €140.86m in revenues with “rest of world” accounting for €89.77m.\nPay to directors decreased by 14pc from €3.37m to €2.9m.\nThe profit takes account of non-cash depreciation costs of €743,093 and non-cash amortisation costs of €300,513.\nAt the end of 2023, Ardmac had accumulated profits of €45.67m. The group’s cash funds increased from €38.74m to €49.16m.\n[\n](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaEoLtFIt5rzvz2Vd22O)\nJoin the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel\nStay up to date with all the latest news",
