    "text": "Kyrie Irving Signs Caris LeVert, Derrick Jones Jr., and Daniel Gafford to ANTA Shoe Deal\nPublishedKyrie Irving’s time with [ANTA](https://www.soleretriever.com/sneaker-release-dates/anta) has seen the NBA superstar launch many different sneakers, including the Kai 1, Kai 1 Speed, and, more recently, the [Kai 1 Team](https://www.soleretriever.com/news/articles/anta-kai-1-team-red-white-release-date-december-2025). On top of new product drops, Kyrie’s role as Chief Creative Officer has allowed him to sign his father, [Dred](https://www.soleretriever.com/news/articles/kyrie-irving-father-drederick-irving-first-signature-athlete-anta-kai-line-2024), to a sneaker deal. In his next move, Irving has signed three NBA stars, Caris LeVert of the Cleveland Cavaliers, Derrick Jones Jr. of the Los Angeles Clippers, and Daniel Gafford of the Dallas Mavericks, to a shoe deal with ANTA.\nOn this new signing, Kyrie stated, “These guys are my brothers, players I’ve shared the journey with. Together, we aim to inspire the future of basketball and create a legacy that resonates globally.” All three players will be rocking colorways from the ANTA Kai collection, which includes the three sneakers mentioned above, over the next few weeks. Previously, [ANTA signed Jimmer Fredette and the entire USA Men’s 3x3 basketball Olympic squad](https://www.soleretriever.com/news/articles/anta-signs-jimmer-fredette-usa-mens-3-x-3-basketball-roster) during the 2024 Summer Olympics.\nCoinciding with the announcement is the official unveiling of the ANTA Kai 1 Team, which dropped on Christmas Day on Dick’s Sporting Goods in a handful of different colorways. Designed by Dallas Stokes, a footwear industry veteran who has worked with various labels over his illustrious career, the model is built with AAU, streetball, and younger players in mind.\nIrving stated, “This shoe is built for the next generation. We spent countless hours studying AAU and streetball players to create a shoe that meets their needs while reflecting my storytelling and style. The KAI 1 Team Shoe is not just for me – it’s for the everyday player striving to create their own story.”\nExpect to see the three new ANTA signees rocking ANTA Kai footwear over the coming NBA season and to appear in marketing efforts for ANTA as a whole. As for the ANTA Kai 1 Team, it is available now in multiple colorways on ANTA’s website and Dick’s Sporting Goods. Available in men’s sizing, the sneaker retails for $100.
