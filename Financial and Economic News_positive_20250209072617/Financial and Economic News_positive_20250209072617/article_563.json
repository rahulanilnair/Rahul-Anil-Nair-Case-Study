    "text": "By Jaylon Thompson ,\n4 hours ago\nThe Kansas City Royals avoided arbitration with six remaining arbitration-eligible players ahead of the 2025 season.\nThe Royals announced Thursday that they have agreed to one-year contracts with Kyle Isbel, MJ Melendez, Kris Bubic, Hunter Harvey, Carlos Hernandez and John Schreiber.\nEach player agreed to a new contract ahead of Thursday’s arbitration deadline.\nIn December, the Royals agreed to a contract for 2025 with veteran starting pitcher Kyle Wright, thus avoiding arbitration\nThe Royals organization do not have any arbitration hearings for the second consecutive year. All seven players who had been eligible for arbitration are now under contract ahead of spring training in Surprise, Arizona.\nThe Royals’ pitchers and catchers are due to report to spring training on Feb. 12. KC’s first Cactus League game is scheduled for Feb. 21.\nKansas City Royals pitcher Kris Bubic (50) pitches in the eighth inning against the New York Yankees during Game 3 of the ALDS at Kauffman Stadium on Oct. 9, 2024. Jay Biggerstaff/Imagn Images Bubic is reverting to a starting role. He will compete for a spot in the starting rotation alongside Cole Ragans, Seth Lugo, Michael Wacha and Michael Lorenzen. Bubic is considered a frontrunner, given his major-league experience.\nThe Royals have depth among their starters. Bubic, who posted a 2.67 ERA in 27 appearances, will compete alongside Wright, Daniel Lynch IV, Alec Marsh and Noah Cameron, among others.\nWright is coming off shoulder surgery. He missed the entire 2024 season and will be making his Royals debut.\nThe Royals also retained outfielders Isbel and Melendez. Isbel is entrenched as the starting center fielder and Melendez is expected to have a significant role. He started in left field in 2024 alongside Isbel and Hunter Renfroe.\nKansas City Royals left fielder MJ Melendez (1), center fielder Garrett Hampson (2) and left fielder Tommy Pham (22) celebrate after defeating the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium on Sept. 10, 2024 in Bronx, New York. Vincent Carchietta/Imagn Images The Royals’ bullpen was bolstered by last season’s additions of Schreiber and Harvey. They, along with Hernandez, remain as veteran relief options.\nSchreiber was solid in a high-leverage role this past season, while Harvey hopes to rebound after a back injury limited him down the stretch.\nAlong with re-signing Wacha and Lorenzen, Royals general manager J.J. Picollo has already acquired infielder Jonathan India from the Cincinnati Reds this offseason (by trading away pitcher Brady Singer).\nThe Royals are still searching for an offensive bat in the middle of the order.",
