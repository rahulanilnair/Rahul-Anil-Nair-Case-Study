    "text": "If you have any medical debt, you’ll be glad to know it will no longer appear on your credit report. On Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced the finalization of a rule that will remove an estimated $49 billion in medical bills from the credit reports of approximately 15 million people nationwide. Keep reading to find out what this means for you.\nWhat does the new rule about medical debt do? The CFPB’s latest action will prohibit the inclusion of medical bills on credit reports used by lenders, who can no longer use an individual’s medical information to determine a person’s credit eligibility.\nThis is an amendment to Regulation V , which implements the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) concerning medical information. With this ruling, the CFPB erases a previous exception that permitted creditors to acquire personal information regarding medical debts and use it in their lending decisions. Additionally, credit bureaus generally cannot give any lending institution a consumer report containing this information.\nLenders will now also be restricted from utilizing information about personal medical devices, such as prosthetic limbs, that may be required to serve as collateral for a loan for repossession purposes.\nHowever, creditors will still be able to consider medical information to verify medical-based forbearances, verify medical expenses that a consumer needs a loan to pay and consider certain benefits as income when underwriting and other legitimate uses.\nWhen it comes to health insurance, you want the best coverage for your needs. Whether you’re updating your employer-sponsored insurance plan, comparing marketplace plans or enrolling in Medicare, understanding 2024 open enrollment deadlines is key. So we turned to the healthcare experts to learn all the need-to-know info regarding open enrollment and tips for signing […] Why did the CFPB create this rule? This action accompanies nationwide credit reporting conglomerates Equifax, Experian and TransUnion announcing that they would take certain types of medical debt off of credit reports, including collections under $500. Additionally, major credit scoring companies FICO and VantageScore announced they have decreased the impact of medical bills on a consumer’s score.\nThe rule is designed with the intent to increase privacy protections and “prevent debt collectors from using the credit reporting system to coerce people to pay bills they don’t owe.”\nThe CFPB conducted research indicating that a medical bill on a person’s credit report is a poor predictor of whether they will repay debts, and contributes to thousands of denied applications on mortgages despite consumers being capable of repaying.\nPay down bills while paying less in interest based on your credit score! The bureau also said consumers frequently report receiving inaccurate bills or being asked to pay bills that should have been covered by insurance or financial assistance programs.\n“People who get sick shouldn’t have their financial future upended,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “The CFPB’s final rule will close a special carveout that has allowed debt collectors to abuse the credit reporting system to coerce people into paying medical bills they may not even owe.”\nHow will this rule impact consumers? AsiaVision/Getty\nSo, what does this mean for U.S. consumers with medical debt? The organization expects the rule will lead to the approval of approximately 22,000 additional mortgages with better terms each year and that Americans with medical debt on their credit reports could see their credit scores rise by an average of 20 points.\nWhile many questions have been raised and, of course, the debt is only being strict from credit reports and not wholly resolved, the news is mostly being met with celebratory reactions from people who feel a sense of relief.\nWhen does the rule take effect? The new regulation is set to take effect in March 2025, 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register.",
