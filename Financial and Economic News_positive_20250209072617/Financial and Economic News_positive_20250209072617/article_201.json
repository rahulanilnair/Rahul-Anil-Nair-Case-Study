These additions will bring the airport into conformity with the latest FAA design and safety standards, officials said.\n\"With the addition of this grant, we have brought over $348 million dollars to Tallahassee since 2020, which is enhancing our transit network, improving utility, service reliability, helping us reach our clean energy goals and more,\" City Manager Reese Goad said.\n\"The Tallahassee International Airport's economic impact and passenger traffic continue to grow year-over-year, with no signs of slowing down, which underscores the importance of our efforts to secure these grant dollars now âˆ’ the timing is perfect,\" city Aviation Director David Pollard said.\nMore on Airport Gateway...
