He said that the export of tractors to Tanzania, an important country in East Africa is encouraging development. Neighboring countries would\nalso buy Pakistani tractors from Tanzania.\nHe said that SIFC has played a fundamental role in this matter, and attention is paid to the production, quality, and export of rice.\nIn 2024, rice exports to Saudi Arabia alone have increased by 25 percent, while total exports have reached US four billion dollars, which are planned to increase to US five billion dollars in 2025.\nIn this regard, focus is being placed on better seeds, research, efficient cultivation, and production methods. He informed that innovation is being adopted to maintain competitiveness in the international rice market.\nMian Zahid Hussain said that Pakistan’s agricultural system is being improved, and a foothold is being established in the global market. The future of agriculture in Pakistan is bright because SIFC is making every possible effort in this regard. Our agricultural production accounts for more than 23 percent of the country’s GDP, and our industry also depends on the farm sector.\nMore than $10 billion in foreign exchange is earned in the form of exports from the cotton obtained from the agricultural sector, while India and China are earning more foreign exchange by 3 to 4 times by value addition of cotton.\nMian Zahid Hussain said that Pakistan is the fourth largest cotton producer in the world, fifth in milk production, sixth in wheat and sugarcane production, eleventh in rice production, sixteenth in meat production, and fourth largest producer of apricot production.\nHowever, we are far behind in processing, packaging, and value addition resulting in a lot of wastage. The country has limited means for water shortage, expensive agricultural inputs, and poor seed quality are also matters of concern.\nMian Zahid Hussain said that Pakistan has the best canal system in the world. Still, much water is wasted before it reaches the fields. Due to the increasing use of pesticides and other chemicals, the water salinity problem is becoming serious, so there is a need to establish a standard for their use.\nLand erosion is a significant problem in rainfed areas, which reduces fertility, land area, agricultural production, forest area, and water reserves.\nIf the agricultural universities in the country are directly connected to the farmers, many problems can be solved.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2025\nSIFC agri development Comments 200 characters Pakistan\nPakistan’s remittance inflow at $3.1bn in December 2024, up 6% month-on-month ‘SIFC’s focus on agri development is yielding promising results’ Intra-day update: rupee registers gain against US dollar SBP governor seems very optimistic about economy Indonesian President’s visit: Ministries asked to finalise trade proposals Los Angeles wildfires devour thousands of homes, death toll rises to 10 PIA resumes Islamabad-Paris flight operations following EASA decision Govt wants to complete PIA privatisation this year PPL begins gas production at Jamshoro exploratory well Oil set for third straight weekly gain on winter fuel demand FY26 budget: Tax, non-tax revenue: 4 base categories identified 20pc criteria violated: Q1 current expenditures stand at Rs3.54trn Read more stories\nForex World Commodity Currency Rate USD PKR Interbank Selling / Jan 10 278.60 USD PKR Interbank Buying / Jan 10 278.40 USD to Japanese Yen / Jan 10 158.39 USD to Swiss Franc / Jan 10 0.91 Pound Sterling to USD / Jan 10 1.23 Euro to USD / Jan 10 1.03 Stock Volume S&P 500 / Jan 9 5,918.25 Nasdaq / Jan 9 19,478.88 FTSE 100 / Jan 9 8,319.69 Dow Jones / Jan 9 42,635.20 Germany DAX 30 / Jan 9 20,317.10 France CAC40 / Jan 9 7,490.28 India Sensex / Jan 10 77,645.98 Tokyo Nikkei / Jan 10 39,265.97 Item Value Karachi Cotton PKR/37.32 KG / Jan 9 18,785 Gold 10 Grams PKR / Jan 9 237,483 Petrol/Litre / Jan 10 252.66 Crude Oil USD/Barrel / Jan 10 74.32 Gold Spot USD/Ounce / Jan 10 2,674.40 Diesel/Litre / Jan 10 258.34 Gainers Losers Leaders Stock Price Pak Gen.Ins. / Jan 10 The Pakistan General Insurance Co.
