Hybrid electric vehicles are designed to provide High levels of performance and fuel efficiency.\nThe market for hybrid electric vehicles is anticipated to witness a moderate growth rate in the coming years, owing to the rising research and development activities in this industry and the strengthening of emission standards on a global scale. However, the growing popularity of electric vehicles will probably hinder market expansion throughout the forecast period. While an increase in demand for hybrid electric cars creates more demand for its maintenance and aftersales services, creating additional revenue generation opportunities for companies operating in the market.\nğ��Šğ���ğ��² ğ��ƒğ���ğ��¯ğ���ğ��¥ğ��¨ğ��©ğ��¦ğ���ğ��§ğ��ğ��¬:\nâ˜…Leading companies are implementing various strategies, including acquisition, agreement, expansion, partnership, contracts, and product launches, to fortify their market positions.\nâ˜…In May 2022, Honda Motor Co., Ltd. introduced the hybrid electric car City to the Indian market. It is the first vehicle in the mainstream market category equipped with standard powerful hybrid electric technology, featuring a self-charging two-motor strong hybrid system paired with a 1.5-liter petrol engine.\nâ˜…In January 2023, TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION launched the all-new Prius HEV in Japan, equipped with the latest fifth-generation hybrid system. The Prius achieves great fuel efficiency and enhanced performance on low-friction road surfaces.\nâ˜…In May 2023, Kia Corporation showcased its new lineup of HEVs in Saudi Arabia, featuring models like K5, K8, Sorento, and Niro Plus. These new models aim to achieve a fuel economy of up to 40%, reflecting Kia Corporation's commitment to reducing carbon emissions and expanding its eco-friendly car offerings.\nğ��“ğ��¡ğ��� ğ��©ğ��šğ��«ğ��šğ��¥ğ��¥ğ���ğ��¥ ğ��¡ğ��²ğ��›ğ��«ğ��¢ğ��� ğ��¬ğ���ğ�� ğ��¦ğ���ğ��§ğ�� ğ��ğ��¨ ğ��¦ğ��šğ��¢ğ��§ğ��ğ��šğ��¢ğ��§ ğ��¢ğ��ğ��¬ ğ��¥ğ���ğ��šğ���ğ���ğ��«ğ��¬ğ��¡ğ��¢ğ��© ğ��¬ğ��ğ��šğ��ğ��®ğ��¬ ğ��ğ��¡ğ��«ğ��¨ğ��®ğ�� ğ��¡ğ��¨ğ��®ğ�� ğ��ğ��¡ğ��� ğ��Ÿğ��¨ğ��«ğ���ğ��œğ��šğ��¬ğ�� ğ��©ğ���ğ��«ğ��¢ğ��¨ğ���\nBased on the powertrain, the parallel hybrid segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for [two-fifths of the global hybrid electric car market revenue](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/press-release/hybrid-electric-car-market.html) and is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period. However, the combined hybrid segment is estimated to grow at the fastest CAGR of 8.5%, owing to combined hybrid ability to offer the driver to switch between engine and electric motor at any given time, this ability is increasing the demand for combined hybrids, which are extensively being used in performance cars and luxury cars.\nğ��“ğ��¡ğ��� ğ��Ÿğ��®ğ��¥ğ��¥ğ��² ğ��¡ğ��²ğ��›ğ��«ğ��¢ğ��� ğ��¬ğ���ğ�� ğ��¦ğ���ğ��§ğ�� ğ��ğ��¨ ğ��¦ğ��šğ��¢ğ��§ğ��ğ��šğ��¢ğ��§ ğ��¢ğ��ğ��¬ ğ��¥ğ���ğ��šğ���ğ���ğ��«ğ��¬ğ��¡ğ��¢ğ��© ğ��ğ��¡ğ��«ğ��¨ğ��®ğ�� ğ��¡ğ��¨ğ��®ğ�� ğ��ğ��¡ğ��� ğ��Ÿğ��¨ğ��«ğ���ğ��œğ��šğ��¬ğ�� ğ��©ğ���ğ��«ğ��¢ğ��¨ğ���\nBased on the degree of hybridization, the fully hybrid segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for more than half of the global hybrid electric car market, and is anticipated to grow at the highest CAGR of 8.6% is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period 2023 to 2032, due to its lower greenhouse gas emissions and lower environmental impact.
