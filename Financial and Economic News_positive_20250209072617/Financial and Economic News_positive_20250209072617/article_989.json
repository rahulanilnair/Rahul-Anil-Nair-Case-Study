    "text": "[Press Release](https://coinpedia.org/press-release/)\nCrypto Arena Shocker: New Presale Coin Set To Surpass DOGE and SHIB With 5x Growth Potential\nRight now, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are meme coins facing some volatility, with red price charts everywhere. However, market experts like Wizz and Alek are still bullish, as they made some bold price predictions for them.\nNevertheless, [DTX Exchange (DTX)](https://dtxexchange.com?utm_source=coinpedia&utm_medium=miki&utm_campaign=53), a new player in the game, is swiftly taking over the crypto market. This token is now in phase seven of its presale and has rewarded early investors with a 600% return. Moreover, its recently launched hybrid trading platform has already onboarded over 300K users. This level of interest is rare in the crypto sphere. Therefore, some analysts hint that DTX could be the next 5x crypto coin in 2025.\nDTX Exchange (DTX) Stuns Early Buyers With a 600% Surge\nAs Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are experiencing price dips, [DTX Exchange (DTX)](https://dtxexchange.com?utm_source=coinpedia&utm_medium=miki&utm_campaign=53) is showing bullish momentum. Many traders are rushing to its crypto ICO event, which has been on fire lately. Notably, early investors in DTX Exchange are already 600% richer.\nRecently, DTX Exchange made headlines by launching its hybrid trading platform, which combines the best of CEX and DEX. On it, people will get access to over 120K asset classes at up to 1000x leverage. These will include CFDs, crypto coins, stocks, etc. Furthermore, no sign-up KYC checks will be needed, meaning traders will always remain anonymous.\nThis launch was preceded by the CoinMarketCap listing of its native token, DTX, which could bring millions of new eyes to this presale. Currently, this crypto coin costs only $0.14 in phase seven of its presale, but its value will rise to $0.16 after phase eight begins. Additionally, traders are waiting for a top-tier crypto exchange to list DTX, triggering a rally to $0.20.\nWizz: The Price of Dogecoin (DOGE) Will Reach $1\nDogecoin (DOGE) is the most well-known name in the meme coin market. However, it has seen some turbulence recently. According to CoinMarketCap, its value has dropped nearly 20% in the past month alone. During that time, the Dogecoin price moved between $0.40 and almost $0.30.\nNevertheless, crypto analyst Wizz remains optimistic about Dogecoin (DOGE). He criticized those who did not hold this meme coin in his X post. As a Dogecoin price prediction, Wizz foresees a potential pump to $1 soon.\nBut, the high Dogecoin market cap of around $49B could be a problem for its long-term growth. In other words, this meme coin will need a lot of new money for its price to see a noteworthy jump. Because of this, many investors are gravitating to tokens like DTX instead.\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Price Looks Ready To Go Past Resistance, Analyst Claims\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is another meme coin showing some bearish movement. On the one-month chart, its value fell from around $0.000027 to nearly $0.000021. In other words, as per CoinMarketCap, the Shiba Inu price dropped over 20% in just a few weeks.\nBut the crypto community is still keeping an eye on Shiba Inu (SHIB) following market expert Alekâ€™s statement. According to his X post, this meme coin has set a cup and handle pattern that could lead to price growth. He predicts a jump to $0.000080 in his Shiba Inu price prediction.\nAlthough the Shiba Inu coin may see a price increase soon, some traders are still cautious. Since SHIB has already surged over 120% on the YTD chart, its highest upswings may have passed. As a result, traders choose to focus on DTX more.\nCan DTX Exchange (DTX) Gain the Upper Hand Over Dogecoin (DOGE) & Shiba Inu (SHIB)?\nAlthough Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) could see big price gains soon, their lack of utility as meme coins could hinder their long-term growth potential. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange (DTX) is a utility token that will give traders governance voting rights and a portion of the trading fee revenue made on this platform. Therefore, adoption may increase faster. Because of this, experts forecast a potential 5x surge for DTX this year.\nFind out more information about DTX Exchange (DTX) by visiting the links below:\nDisclaimer and Risk Warning\nThe content featured on Coinpedia's press release page is provided for informational purposes only.
