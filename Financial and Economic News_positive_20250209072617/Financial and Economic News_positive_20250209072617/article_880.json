    "text": "Viridien (ex CGG) reports that its revenues and EBITDA for fiscal 2024 should be slightly above $1.1 billion and $430 million respectively, in line with its own forecasts.\nThe geosciences group also expects net cash generation of around $50 million, exceeding its initial target of around $30 million, and leading to net debt (after IFRS 16) of around $930 million.\nFor the full year 2025, Viridien reiterates its net cash generation target of around $100 million, saying it is encouraged by 'the performance of DDE and the successful execution of the transformation plan for the SMO segment'.\nCopyright (c) 2025 CercleFinance.com.
