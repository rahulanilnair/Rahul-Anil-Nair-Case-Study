    "text": "By Bode Brooks ,\n7 hours ago\nFRANKFORT, Ky. ( FOX 56 ) — Kentucky House lawmakers have passed their first major piece of policy for 2025.\nWith 90 votes to pass, House Bill 1 is now on its way to the Senate. After roughly an hour of debate, some Democrats joined Republicans in passing the bill, but not without warning about the direction of the state’s finances.\nLATEST KENTUCKY NEWS: Georgetown police ask for help identifying man Here’s what Lexington road crews are doing to prepare as state receives Winter Storm Warning Bill to lower Kentucky’s income tax again clears first hurdle “This is another iteration of what we have been engaged in for multiple years, and I would move for final passage,” HB 1 Sponsor Rep. Jason Petrie (R-Elkton) said.\nLeaders in Kentucky’s General Assembly aim to eliminate the state income tax. Three years ago, they passed House Bill 8, a formula of financial triggers that, when met, would slowly initiate cuts to the income tax by a half percent. House Bill 1 sets the next cut in motion from 4% to 3.5%.\n“Until this morning, I was not 100% sure which way I was going to vote,” Rep. Chad Aull (D-Lexington) said.\nThe plan has largely proceeded without Democrat support in past sessions. They have shared concern that the state could face a financial crisis down the road and have argued an income tax cut disproportionately benefits wealthier Kentuckians.\nLATEST KENTUCKY LISTS AND RANKINGS: Kentucky ranks in top 10 states with underage vaping amid new 2025 law Kentucky among top 15 states with most deaths from house fires Lexington ranks among best Christmas cities in US, according to WalletHub “When we talk about reducing the income tax rate, we must ask ourselves at what cost, what new consumption taxes will be added. That puts a much greater and harmful financial burden on those who can least afford it,” Rep. Adrielle Camuel (D-Lexington) said.\nCamuel was among the handful of Democrats that ultimately voted for the bill, saying the bill does provide some help to those she represents. Republicans say they’re hoping to replicate what’s occurred in other states with lower income taxes that have benefitted from population growth.\n“Kentucky is a poor state. We are not going to tax our way to prosperity. We all want to support the Medicaid programs and the schools and fund all the things that we all care about. But you can’t do it by overtaxing folks. We do it by growth,” Rep. Jason Nemes (R-Middletown) said.\nSeven Democrats withheld their support for the bill. It will now be heard in the Senate when lawmakers return for part two of the session in February. Gov. Andy Beshear has previously told FOX 56 he’s likely to sign the bill when it reaches his desk.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
