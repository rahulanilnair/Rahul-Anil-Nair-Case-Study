It would travel through Butte-Silver Bow County, Anaconda-Deer Lodge County and the counties of Powell, Granite, Missoula and Mineral.\nAn aerial view of the Silver Bow Creek Greenway near Fairmont. As envisioned, the 262-mile Parks to Passes trail would incorporate the Silver Bow Creek Greenway.\nJOSEPH SCHELLER, The Montana Standard The news came in an email from the office of U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Montana.\nCooley, who expressed gratitude for the support of Daines’ office, said the effort to shepherd the regional trail project has benefited from remarkable collaboration and cooperation across cities and rural counties.\n“We look forward to the day we can bike, walk or ride a horse from Butte to Superior — visiting all the small towns and businesses along the way,” Cooley said.\n“I am so proud of our team’s work,” she said. “We bridged together city governments, county governments, city-county governments, many local nonprofits and the U.S. Forest Service to create a project that is by Montana for Montana.”\nAs envisioned, Parks to Passes will incorporate existing trails in the corridor along the Clark Fork River and Interstate 90. It could also potentially occupy abandoned stretches of railbeds once serving the former Milwaukee Road.\nStitching it all together would require obtaining easements across private property in some areas, an often thorny and time-consuming process. Work on the 26-mile Silver Bow Creek Greenway began nearly 20 years ago and much work remains.\nDori Skrukrud, a community development coordinator for Butte-Silver Bow County, is project manager for the Silver Bow Creek Greenway, which would be incorporated into the Parks to Passes trail.\nSkrukrud responded Thursday to news of the grant funding.\n“The partnership of the six participating cities and counties is a great example of what can be accomplished with collaboration,” she said. “Participants from small rural areas to major metropolitan communities worked together to craft a project that ultimately can connect communities, improve public safety and boost economic activity in a state where outdoor recreation is a valuable resource.”\nPowell County and partners had applied twice to secure RAISE grant funding.\n“We were recognized as a Project of Merit in the 2024 funding cycle, which meant that we made it through all rounds of review with high marks but were not funded,” Cooley said. “We were provided an opportunity to be considered in the 2025 cycle in a priority round of funding.”\nThe Old Yellowstone Trail travels between Deer Lodge and Garrison. The trail's 10 miles would be incorporated into the Parks to Passes trail.\nDuncan Adams, The Montana Standard What’s next?\nCooley said Parks to Passes hopes to hire a project manager to shepherd planning of the complex project and investigate what needs to happen before launching work on the ground.\nShe said a key focus will be engaging the public about the project.\nAllies in the effort to gain traction for Parks to Passes have included backers like Diane Magone in Mineral County, Ed Brunsvold in Granite County, Aaron Wilson with the Missoula Metropolitan Planning Organization and Jackson Lee, a parks and trails project specialist for Missoula County.\nLee and Cooley have collaborated to actively pursue the funding and both expressed excitement about the grant award.\nJuanita Vero is chair of the Missoula County Board of Commissioners.\n“Missoula County is proud to be a part of this regional partnership, and we are excited to hear about the RAISE award announcement,” she said Thursday.\n“Parks to Passes represents much more than the idea of a regional trail system; it's an investment in local infrastructure and rural spaces,” Vero said. “Parks to Passes transitions decades of siloed thinking and development efforts into a cohesive, regional conduit for infrastructure planning and investment.”\nVero noted that the Parks to Passes effort is being led by rural communities and is “all about enhancing pedestrian accessibility and safety, providing connections between and within communities and helping ensure parents and caregivers can send their children out the door with a safe route to school.”\nDrummond is one community that could benefit from safer options for crossing from the business district to the Clark Fork River, Brunsvold said in April. He said then that Parks to Passes could also yield economic benefits for the small town sandwiched between I-90 and the river.\nAs envisioned, in addition to including the Silver Bow Creek Greenway, Parks to Passes would incorporate the 10-mile Old Yellowstone Trail in Powell County, developed trails in Missoula County and Missoula and some 30 miles of the Olympian Trail in Mineral County.\nAmanda Cooley, planning director for Powell County, discussed the proposed Parks to Passes Trail during an April 23 gathering in Deer Lodge. She and Jackson Lee of Missoula County helped apply for federal funding for trail study.\nDuncan Adams, The Montana Standard That would leave gaps of about 157 miles.\nThe Parks to Passes trail would become part of the Great American Rail-Trail, which ultimately would stretch some 3,700 miles from Washington, D.C., to Washington state.\nOnce complete in Montana, the Great American Rail-Trail would travel about 427 miles in the state. A study by Headwaters Economics estimated the completed trail’s annual benefits to Montana would include $16 million in visitor spending, $800,000 in new tax revenue and 210 new jobs.\nBrooke Lincoln owns the 50,000 Silver Dollar Bar in Mineral County.\n“As our region’s economy changes, it will become even more important to have multiuse trails connecting our towns, drawing visitors and creating opportunities for recreation,” Lincoln said last year. “As an employer, more trails will help me attract customers and talent.”\nCooley said the state’s Natural Resource Damage Program has been supportive. Part of NRDP’s role is to provide access to recreation lost in years past to pollution tied to mining and smelting upstream in Butte and Anaconda.\nBackers anticipate the planning and feasibility phase of Parks to Passes will require two to three years. One focus will be engagement with private landowners along the proposed path.\nThe federal Department of Transportation says RAISE projects “are rigorously reviewed and evaluated on statutory criteria of safety, environmental sustainability, quality of life, mobility and community connectivity, economic competitiveness and opportunity including tourism, state of good repair, partnership and collaboration and innovation.”\nCooley said news about the RAISE grant was heartening.\n“There was a lot of disappointment coming out of 2024,” she said.\n0 Comments",
