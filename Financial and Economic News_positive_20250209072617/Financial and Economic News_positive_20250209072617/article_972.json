    "text": "Global air travel demand continued its upward trajectory in November 2024, as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) released data showing an 8.1% increase in total passenger demand compared to the same month in 2023.\nThe robust growth was driven largely by international markets, which saw demand rise by 11.6%, reflecting strong performances from European and Asia-Pacific carriers. Despite the rising demand, airlines continue to face significant challenges in meeting this surge due to ongoing supply chain issues.\nAirlines globally were able to achieve record load factors of 83.4% for the month, as total capacity only grew by 5.7% year-on-year, lagging behind the demand increase. This disparity between demand and capacity has highlighted the challenges airlines face in securing enough aircraft to meet rising passenger numbers, an issue exacerbated by delays in aircraft deliveries. As a result, many airlines are operating with higher load factors, which means flights are fuller and passengers may encounter limited availability.\nIn international markets, Asia-Pacific led the way with a significant 19.9% year-on-year increase in demand. This surge was fueled by continued recovery in passenger traffic within the region, particularly in key markets like China and India, where travel demand remains robust. European carriers also saw an 8.3% rise in demand, with the region boasting the highest load factor at 85.3%. Latin America saw similarly strong growth, with demand up 11.4%, driven by a strong rebound in travel across the region.\nWhile international demand soared, North America lagged behind, showing a modest decline in domestic demand by 0.7%. The contraction in the U.S. domestic market, down by 2.7%, marked the continuation of a slowing trend observed since mid-2024. This has been attributed to reduced activity from low-cost carriers, although major U.S. carriers have continued to see steady growth.\nDespite the overall increase in global passenger demand, the airline industry remains constrained by capacity challenges, with the supply chain issues in the aerospace manufacturing sector continuing to hamper airlines’ ability to expand their fleets. IATA’s Director General, Willie Walsh, emphasized the need for a solution to these issues, which are preventing airlines from fully capitalizing on the demand for air travel. Walsh noted that airlines are unable to modernize their products or improve their environmental performance due to delays in aircraft deliveries.\nThe ongoing supply chain bottlenecks have also impacted airlines’ ability to meet growing passenger demand and limit their ability to offer more competitive routes, which may have a long-term impact on the air travel industry’s ability to recover fully. With airlines already operating at near full capacity, this underscores the urgent need for efficient solutions to these supply chain disruptions in the coming months.\nThe report from IATA also highlighted the strong performance of airlines in key international markets such as Asia-Pacific and Europe, which helped offset slower growth in North America. As the demand for air travel continues to rise globally, airlines will need to find innovative ways to expand capacity and meet passengers’ expectations while navigating persistent challenges in the aircraft supply chain.\nAs the year draws to a close, the aviation industry will be hoping for resolutions to these challenges in 2025. Despite these ongoing issues, the global recovery in air travel is clear, with the potential for continued growth in 2025 provided airlines can secure the aircraft needed to meet demand. For now, passengers can expect busy skies and crowded flights as the industry works to bridge the gap between demand and supply.\n[News Ghana](https://newsghana.com.gh)on\n[Google News](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAiENOAw7LsGXCOM4baC2AVg8cqFAgKIhDTgMOy7BlwjjOG2gtgFYPH?hl=en-GH&gl=GH&ceid=GH%3Aen)",
