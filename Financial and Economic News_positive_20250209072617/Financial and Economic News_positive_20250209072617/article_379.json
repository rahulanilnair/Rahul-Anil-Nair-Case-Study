    "text": "Latest news about Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies. Your daily crypto news habit.\n- XRP gains 476% from November 4th to December 3rd\n- Outperforms Ethereum on Google Trends since mid-2024, completely outpacing the second-largest currency since November\n- XRP remains up 355% from pre-November value\nOne of the fastest-rising altcoins of 2024’s last quarter, Ripple Labs’ XRP continues to maintain its popularity this year.\nBefore this major surge in value and recognition, XRP became notorious for Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Since 2020, the crypto company has been [defending](https://www.bitcoinsensus.com/news/ripple-clo-criticized-sec-chair-gary-genslers-attempt-to-justify-his-anti-crypto-initiatives/) its case against the commission that XRP sales do not characterize unregistered security sales.\nThe negative pressure accumulating from a potential lawsuit loss caused XRP to become a volatile asset to hold throughout the years. However, since the end of 2024, this story appears to have changed.\nSince November 5th, XRP has gained a substantial amount of value, leading the currency to become the third most valuable cryptocurrency in the market, by market capitalization. To put it in numbers, XRP gained 476% in value from November 4th to its peak on December 3rd. A month later the altcoin is still up 355% from its pre-November value.\nXRP Outperforms Ethereum on Google Trends\nDespite being considered the second-most-popular cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, Ethereum has been less popular than Ripple’s XRP since mid-2024, according to Google Trends.\nThe metric that measures how popular a specific keyword is on the world’s most popular search engine, reveals that XRP has been searched up to 10 times more than the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\nFrom 2021 until 2023, “Ethereum” was by far the most popular keyword being searched, when compared to “XRP”. The story began to change around 2023’s second half after New York Judge Anelisa Torres made a [ruling](https://www.bitcoinsensus.com/news/xrp-surge-ripple-case-boosts-price-amid-optimism/) that could point to a potential Ripple Labs victory against the SEC.\nBut even then, XRP and Ethereum continued to rank similarly in Google’s [platform](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2024-11-04%202025-01-09&q=xrp,ethereum&hl=en). However, since the November rally that caused XRP to gain a tremendous amount of value, the trendy altcoin has been completely outperforming Ethereum.\nSince November 12, XRP outworked Ethereum on a consistent basis, a feat that endures to this day.\nThis impressive achievement highlights the growing confidence and interest in XRP among investors.\nThe information provided in this article is for informational and educational purposes only and does not constitute financial, investment, or trading advice.
