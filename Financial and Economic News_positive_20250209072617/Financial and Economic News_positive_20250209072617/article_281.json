    "text": "Investors are targeting a move to $10 on the Dogecoin price and Shiba Inu (SHIB) to $0.01, but Ex-Morgan Stanley experts are pointing to the more realistic 70,000% potential ROI on WallitIQ (WLTQ) . Experts are pointing to WallitIQ (WLTQ) as a pick with far superior potential in the brewing bull run while it’s trading at $0.0420 on presale.\nRead on to discover what positions this new coin as the better choice for profits over big names like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).\nWallitIQ (WLTQ) Set To Outperform Other Popular Altcoins In This Bull Run\nWallitIQ (WLTQ) is a new AI project that aims to launch a crypto wallet integrated with artificial intelligence and machine learning models to make institutional wallet technology more consumable at the retail level. Experts believe the new solution could massively drive adoption, creating the perfect situation for high demand.\nThe complex nature of the blockchain and most crypto wallets add to the issues of security, user experience, and literacy in the decentralized wallet ecosystem, but WallitIQ (WLTQ) promises to fix these issues.\nWallitIQ (WLTQ) is already seeing massive early adoption for its approach to fixing simple problems. However, the new AI wallet promises a lot more for crypto users who want to do more with their wallet apps. This new wallet app will introduce an AI-powered portfolio management system that allows users to better understand the complexities of crypto investments.\nAlongside this superior framework, investors will have access to predictive analytics and market insights to help them anticipate future market trends. Machine learning models are proven to be highly effective in financial markets for predictive analytics, and free access to these tools on the WallitIQ (WLTQ) wallet could vastly improve trading decisions.\nAdditionally, WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents smart transaction solutions such as timely transactions tailored to minimize loss during large transactions. With timely transactions, the AI analyzes the optimal conditions for executing a transaction, considering factors like slippage, gas prices, transaction amounts, etc.\nThe impressive AI solution on WallitIQ (WLTQ) sets a high ceiling for the new token, and experts believe this could be a better runner than Shiba Inu (SHIB) or the Dogecoin price. Also, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has passed multiple smart contract audits by SolidProof to ascertain its security. The new token is also on CoinMarketCap ahead of its listing on DEX.\nDogecoin (DOGE) And Shiba Inu (SHIB) Investors Seek New Investment Alternatives\nInvestors are setting massive predictions for Shiba Inu (SHIB) and the Dogecoin price in this bull run. However, experts believe the predictions on the meme coins may be recency bias, with investors expecting a price rally similar to the previous bull run.\nWhile Shiba Inu (SHIB) and the Dogecoin price are in a good position for a price run to their all-time high and possible new all-time highs, they do not offer an opportunity to make huge returns with small investments. As of this writing, the Dogecoin price is at $0.3845, which shows impressive 370% gains over the past year. However, at its $56 billion market cap, the $10 Dogecoin price predictions set the target too high for the coin.\nExperts also believe the $0.01 Shiba Inu (SHIB) prediction is a bit more overreaching. It sets the meme coin at a potential $7 trillion market cap, which is even bigger than the current total crypto market capitalization. As of this writing, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00002404 and has a $14 billion market cap.\nShiba Inu (SHIB) has only shown about a 150% price gain in the past year and is believed to be underperforming in comparison to the Dogecoin price. Experts believe Shiba Inu (SHIB) could be at a discount entry as it’s expected to rival the Dogecoin price as market trends grow more bullish.\nHowever, the new AI-powered coin WallitIQ (WLTQ) is showing more prospects and looks to be a better investment pick for this bull market.\nConclusion\nWallitIQ (WLTQ) is already showing its hand on the ongoing presale, raising millions in a matter of weeks, with investors still scrambling for cheap entry. This new coin promises huge gains at token launch, and the bigger prize awaits investors with a long-term approach. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is hugely undervalued in comparison to Shiba Inu (SHIB) and the Dogecoin price, allowing that runway early investors are capitalizing on for life-changing profits.\nGet in now while WallitIQ (WLTQ) is still $0.0420 on presale before the price is raised to $0.0620.\nJoin the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale and community:\nJoin WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale\nJoin the WallitIQ (WLTQ) Community",
