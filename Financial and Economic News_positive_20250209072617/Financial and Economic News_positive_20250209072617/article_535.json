    "text": "SEATTLE (Scrap Monster): In December 2024, the worldwide gold ETF flows turned back to being positive. The largest contributors to the $778 flows were Asia and Europe. $748 million was invested in the Asian funds. In the final month of the previous year, there were modest inflows of $337 million into the European funds. Conversely, North American ETFs saw modest declines, dropping $342 million.\nIn December 2024, gold trade volumes on international markets fell 24% month over month to an average of $221 per day.\nALSO READ:\n[WGC Foresees Rangebound Gold Prices in 2025](/news/wgc-2025-outlook-gold-prices-likely-to-remain-rangebound/1/94172)\n[Gold in 2024 Posted the Best Performance in 14 Years](/news/performance-was-the-best-in-14-years/1/94374)\nAccording to the most recent report released by the World Gold Council (WGC), the inflows caused the total assets under management (AUM) of gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to reach a new high of $271 billion in 2024. The prior year saw a 26% increase in the overall AUM, driven by the skyrocketing price of gold. It should be mentioned that throughout the past year, the price of gold has reached new all-time highs up to 40 times.\nIn 2024, the total holdings of gold ETFs decreased by 0.2 percent, according to WGC. The largest inflows were still from Asia. For the first time since 2020, the North American funds had a positive annual flow. In addition, European outflows decreased dramatically compared to 2023.\n|",
