    "text": "Kaival Brands Stock Surges As E-Cigarettes Maker Puts To Vote Merger, Sparks Retail Chatter Kaival stockholders will receive about $31 million of Pubco ordinary shares and Delta stockholders will receive about $270 million worth of Pubco shares.\nStocktwits Inc First Published Jan 10, 2025, 11:01 AM IST | Last Updated Jan 10, 2025, 11:01 AM IST Follow Shares of Kaival Brands Innovation Group ($KAVL) rose 15% on Wednesday as the nicotine products maker called for a special meeting of its stockholders to vote on its proposed merger with Delta Corp Holdings Ltd, sparking retail chatter on Stocktwits.\nMessage volumes spiked nearly 3,075% on Wednesday compared to a day ago with retail sentiment remaining largely bullish.\nIn September, Kaival entered into a merger agreement with Delta that will combine Kaival and Delta and become wholly owned subsidiaries of Pubco, which according to the company’s earlier statement, would become a new publicly listed holding company and list shares on Nasdaq.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Kaival stockholders will receive about $31 million of Pubco ordinary shares and Delta stockholders will receive about $270 million of Pubco shares, at an estimated implied diluted value per share of $2.66, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nEach of Kaival’s issued and outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, shall convert into shares of Kaival common stock at the conversion rate of approximately 0.4 shares of Kaival common stock per share of Series B preferred stock, according to the filing. The board of Kaival has approved the business combination.\nOne Stocktwits user was enthusiastic about an opportunity to trade in the pre-market.\nKaival is engaged in the sale, marketing, and distribution of electronic nicotine products including its flagship ‘Bidi’ stick. Delta Corp, based in England and Wales, is a privately held holding company for global businesses engaged in bulk and energy logistics, fuel supply, commodities, and asset management.\nKaival stock is 3% year-to-date.\nFor updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com.<\nFor more reliable and latest news subscribe to Asianet Newsable WhatsApp channel by clicking here.
