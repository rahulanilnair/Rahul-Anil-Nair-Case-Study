    "text": "EASTON, Pa. - Big things are happening for ProJeCt of Easton in 2025.\nThe nonprofit recently completed its purchase of the Confluence Community Center, as well as an adjacent parking lot, on the city's southside.\nLongandfoster.com According to Northampton County property records, ProJeCt of Easton paid $575,000 for each parcel.\nKeith Lampman-Perlman, director of development for ProJeCt, confirmed the purchases, and said the organization would have much more to announce about its future plans for the property soon.\nProJeCt traces its roots to the 1960s, when a coalition of Protestant, Jewish, and Catholic community leaders decided to join forces to make a positive impact on the Easton area. Early efforts included the establishment of a youth center, a dental clinic, a well-baby clinic, and a shelter program.\nIn the years that followed, the nonprofit expanded to offer even more services, including literacy programs, adult education, a food pantry, and a free summer camp for Easton kids. Its goal is uplifting low-income, at-risk residents through the power of education and community support.\nLampman-Perlman said the myriad programs and services help more than 7,000 people a year.\nProJeCt currently has three locations in Easton. Its administrative offices are at 320 Ferry Street; its food pantry is at 330 Ferry Street; and it offers programming at the Fowler Literacy Center at 200 Ferry Street.\nThe Confluence Community Center at 610 W. Berwick Street was previously St. Paul's Lutheran Church, which was built in 1888.\nThe community center celebrated its grand opening in June of 2023. It's unknown when programming there ceased. Its website is no longer active.\nAccording to real estate records, the 22,824 square foot building was listed in July of 2024.\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",
