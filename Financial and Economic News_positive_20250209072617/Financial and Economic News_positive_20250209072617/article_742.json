    "text": "SLIPPERY ROCK — Council members approved an increased budget for the Parks and Recreation department on Tuesday, Jan. 7, to reflect increased utility and labor costs. According to Mayor J.D. Longo, there is an expected “$20,000 to $25,000 increase in labor costs” for the upcoming year. To offset increased expenses, the council approved an increased cost for programs.\n“The park has had a steady cost for programs,” Longo said. “This is the first increase we’ve done in three or four years.”\nIn other business ■ The council nominated Longo for the Association of Mayors of the Boroughs of Pennsylvania Mayor of the Year award.\n■ The council acknowledged a recall related to the engine of one of their police cruisers.
