    "text": "WESTLAND, Mich. (WWJ) - A Westland woman surprised her family at Christmas with news that she won a $1 million Powerball prize, the Michigan Lottery reports.\nCatherine Martin, 63, had played the multi-state lottery game on Sept. 4, purchasing her ticket at MD Westland LLC at 32919 Cherry Hill Road in Westland. The numbers drawn for the five white balls were 07-10-21-33-59.\n\"I play Powerball every week and use a special set of numbers,\" Martin said. \"The day after the drawing, I got a call from my husband while I was at work telling me that he checked my Powerball ticket, and I'd won $1 million.\"\nShe was stunned and didn't believe him at first. But they decided to keep the big news to themselves until the holidays.\n\"We have kept our win a secret until we finally surprised our family on Christmas with the big news,\" Martin said.\nShe visited Michigan Lottery headquarters in Lansing recently to claim her prize. She plans to invest, save for retirement and set aside money for her grandchildren's college funds.\n\"It is incredibly rewarding to hear how this prize will not only have a positive impact on the winner, but on her grandchildren as well, as she plans to put a portion of her winnings towards their college educations,\" said Michigan Lottery Commissioner Suzanna Shkreli.\nThe next Powerball drawing is Saturday, with an estimated jackpot of $263 million for those who match the numbers on five white balls and the Powerball. Those who match only the five white balls win $1 million.\nMartin was the top Powerball winner on Sept. 4, being the only person to win $1 million from that drawing. There was no jackpot winner on that date.\nPowerball tickets can be purchased for $2 at Lottery retailers across Michigan and [MichiganLottery.com](http://MichiganLottery.com). A \"Power Play\" that adds to some prizes can be added for $1.",
