The latest ruling builds upon the injunction by overturning the Title IX rules completely.\n\"This is a huge win for Tennessee, for common sense, and for women and girls across America,\" AG Skrmetti said. \"The court's ruling is yet another repudiation of the Biden administration's relentless push to impose a radical gender ideology through unconstitutional and illegal rulemaking. Because the Biden rule is vacated altogether, President Trump will be free to take a fresh look at our Title IX regulations when he returns to office next week.\"",
