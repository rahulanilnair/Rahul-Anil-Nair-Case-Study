    "text": "Inflation Reduction Act Money available for Wisconsin homeowners\nRUSK COUNTY, Wis. (WEAU) - Life is good for the Krugs in their Rusk County home. What made it even better were all the improvements made possible through recently available funds.\n“When we got the place it was all 2x4’s and broken windows,” said Steven Krug.\nThe house was in need of upgrades and money through the Inflation Reduction Act helped make the work possible. An energy assessment of the home is what started the process.\n“Steve actually contacted us and we gave them a link to the IRA program. They fill out the application and then called us to have an energy assessment done,” said David Geissler.\nHe is the owner of On-Site Performance Testing, LLC. Fancy gadgets are what Geissler used to determine the type of work that would be needed to make the Krug home more energy efficient.\n“Steve actually contacted us and we gave them a link to the IRA program. They fill out the application and then called us to have an energy assessment done,” said Geissler.\n[Focus on Energy](https://focusonenergy.com/home-energy-rebates) is a Wisconsin program that has helped many homeowners get utility-related work done through incentives. But, with a recent infusion of IRA federal dollars, more projects are eligible for rebates.\nThat includes work on insulating the home or work on the HVAC system.\n“We’re retired. A little on social security. Of course, we didn’t have any excess cash to be helping to pay to finish the house,” said Krug.\n$6,000 is what the Krugs saved on their home thanks to IRA funds. Steven said at the end of the day, he paid a sum of $0 for all the work that needed to be done based on Geissler’s assessment.\nAll Wisconsin residents can go to [Focus on Energy](https://focusonenergy.com/home-energy-rebates) and fill out an application for the IRA money. The website also lists businesses that help customers out with navigating the program.\n“It is a game changer and it’s a great opportunity for homeowners to make their houses more energy efficient. And, to receive a lot of incentives to do it,” said Geissler.\n“Go to Focus and fill out the forms, see what you qualify for, and take it from there,” said Krug.\nCopyright 2025 WEAU.
