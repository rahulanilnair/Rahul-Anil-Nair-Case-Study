Furthermore, global inflation rates have decreased, encouraging Pakistani migrants to send more money back home.\nDr Khaqan Najeeb, former Advisor at the Ministry of Finance, told Thenews.com.pk that remittances have seen a substantial rise aided by several tailwinds.\n\"This has included expansion of the Pakistani diaspora, higher earnings in key destination countries, exchange rate stabilisation (reduced difference between interbank and open market) pushing formal channels, and improved digital infrastructure.\"\nIt is also important to remember, he said, that with high bouts of inflation in the country there is increased demand for support at home from people working abroad. \"Higher remittances have played a key role in managing the country’s external account.\"\nRemittances inflows during December 2024 were mainly sourced from Saudi Arabia ($770.6 million), the United Arab Emirates ($631.5 million), the United Kingdom ($456.9 million) and the United States of America ($284.3 million).\nOther GCC countries from where money was sent back home include Oman ($108.5 million), Qatar ($89.2 million), Kuwait ($71.1 million), and Bahrain ($41.2 million), the SBP data showed.\nRemittances from the diaspora are a crucial source of external financing for Pakistan as they not only help enhance foreign exchange reserves, but also support the balance of payments.\nMoreover, both the central bank and the government expect remittances to hit a record $35 billion in FY25.\nSBP governor urges business community to ramp up exports amid ongoing shortfall Govt hopes Rs10-12 per unit cut in electricity prices amid 'ongoing talks with IMF' ADB upgrades Pakistan's growth prospects to 3% for FY25 Market slumps over tax amendment concern, profit-taking Wealth rankings: Who are in Jan 2025’s club of the richest?
