    "text": "Shasta County supervisors settle lawsuit with former sheriff's captain for $2.8 million Damon Arthur Redding Record Searchlight Show Caption\nHide Caption\nSheriff's deputies remove Redding woman from meeting Shasta County sheriff's deputies escorted Redding resident Jenny Nowain in handcuffs from the Thursday, Nov. 7, 2024, supervisors' meeting. Less than a month after recognizing Pat Kropholler for his 28 years with the Shasta County Sheriff's Office, the Board of Supervisors this week voted to award him nearly $2.8 million by settling a lawsuit he filed against his former employer.\nThe retired sheriff's captain sued the county in 2022, claiming former Sheriff Eric Magrini retaliated against him after he submitted a whistleblower letter to the county outlining alleged wrongdoing in the sheriff's office.\nKropholler, who was 50 when he filed the lawsuit, also claimed he was a victim of age discrimination. He said he planned to work until he was 55, but because of the \"hostile\" environment, he retired five years earlier than he planned.\nAt the board meeting Tuesday, Jan. 7, the supervisors approved budget amendments of $2,791,815 to pay for the settlement. Some three weeks earlier, on Dec. 19, the board held a ceremony for Kropholler to recognize his 28 years working for the sheriff's office.\nDuring the event, board Chairman Kevin Crye praised Kropholler, and current Sheriff Michael Johnson also spoke of his years of dedication.\n\"Capt. Krophollers' passion for service, innovation and dedication of public safety has left an indelible mark on Shasta County. We thank him for his outstanding contributions, and wish him the very best in this next chapter of life,\" Crye said.\nAll five members of the board stood and applauded Kropholler and took photos with him.\nNote to readers: If you appreciate the work we do, please consider subscribing to the Record Searchlight/Redding.com or give the gift of a subscription to someone you know.\nBut Benjamin Nowain, a former county employee who said he also submitted a whistleblower letter and was let go from his job, said the supervisors should address the issues that caused Kropholler to sue.\n\"Settling this case is effectively an admission that a hostile work environments exists within Shasta County government. This is not just one individual. It is about a pattern of behavior that undermines the integrity of this institution,\" Nowain said.\n\"If the county is prepared to allocate significant funds, potentially millions of taxpayer dollars, to address claims stemming from hostile workplace allegations, where is the accountability? How will this board ensure that such issues are addressed proactively in the future, so that no other employee must endure what Mr. Kropholler experienced, like I experienced,\" Nowain said.\nNone of the board members responded to Nowain's questions.\nShortly before Magrini left his job as sheriff to become assistant county executive, the sheriff and the undersheriff at the time wrongfully placed Kropholler on administrative leave for failing to give proper notice he was going on vacation, placing a sergeant in charge of department records and failing to notify them of an employee harassment complaint, according to Kropholler's lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit also alleged Magrini misused a California law enforcement communication system to run a background check when the county was hiring former CEO Matt Pontes. Magrini also disagreed over an investigation into an officer-involved shooting involving former sheriff's Sgt. Jose Gonzalez.\nThe sheriff wanted Kropholler to \"conceal exculpatory information which would have likely resulted in a wrongful criminal prosecution of Sgt. Gonzales,\" according to the lawsuit.\nThe district attorney's office ruled there was not enough evidence to prosecute Gonzalez in the February 2020 shooting, but last year the county settled for $12 million another lawsuit filed by the family of Thomas Barbosa, who was killed in the encounter in Ono.\nReporter Damon Arthur welcomes story tips at 530-338-8834, by email at damon.arthur@redding.com and on X, formerly known as Twitter, at @damonarthur_RS .
