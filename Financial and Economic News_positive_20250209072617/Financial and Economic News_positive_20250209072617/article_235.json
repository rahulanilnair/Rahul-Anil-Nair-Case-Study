China’s new yuan loans are expected to have risen by almost 38% in December 2024 from the month before, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, as confidence in taking out debt grew stronger on the back of Beijing’s fiscal measures to spur economic growth.\nStill, domestic consumer inflation slowed last month, while factory-gate deflation extended into a second year in 2024.\nA combination of job insecurity, a prolonged housing downturn, high debt and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s tariff threats have hit demand even as Beijing ramps up stimulus measures to revive its consumer sector.\nShanghai Futures Exchange rubber Japan rubber Comments 200 characters",
