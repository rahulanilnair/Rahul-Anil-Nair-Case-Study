    "text": "In 2024, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson significantly outpaced John Cena in earnings, solidifying his status as one of the highest-paid entertainers globally. Even though they are both legends in their own right for the WWE, it is evident that The Rock has proved to be a money-making machine in the last year when compared to John Cena, because you really couldn’t see him as much. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s Earnings:In film projects alone, Johnson commanded a record-breaking $50 million upfront salary for his role in the 2024 film, Red One, marking the largest upfront payment for a single movie before backend points. With the release of the children's movie Moana, he was able to negotiate a higher salary with Disney. Past films’ expenses also came through for him as they cut deals with streaming platforms, both as an actor and producer, a prime example of the same being Baywatch. As for business ventures, his entrepreneurial endeavors, particularly his stake in Teremana Tequila, have been substantial contributors to his income. The tequila brand’s valuation is estimated at around $2 billion, with Johnson’s ownership stake significantly enhancing his net worth. By 2024, Johnson’s net worth was estimated to be approximately $800 million, reflecting his diverse income streams from acting, business ventures, and endorsements. John Cena’s Earnings: Cena earned an annual salary of approximately $8.5 million from his WWE commitments, which is expected to increase now that he has announced his goodbye tour with the company. In addition to his wrestling income, Cena commanded around $5 million per movie role, contributing to his overall earnings, and as of 2024, Cena’s net worth was estimated to be around $80 million, placing him among the wealthiest WWE superstars, second only to The Rock.Also Read:Is The Rock the True Hollywood King?Comparison:Johnson's lucrative movie roles and profitable business endeavors, especially his role in Teremana Tequila, are the main causes of the significant salary gap between him and Cena in 2024. Even though Cena still makes a lot of money from acting and wrestling, his earnings and net worth are still far less than Johnson's. They should be viewed as equals since they are both the highest-paid WWE superstars and their futures appear bright.",
