    "text": "Lebanon lawmakers elected army commander Joseph Aoun as the country’s first president in more than two years, picking a U.S.-backed candidate in a sign of Iran’s waning influence in the region.\nMore than two-thirds of politicians voted for Aoun to begin a six-year term, clearing a hurdle that hadn’t been met in several recent failed attempts. His win ends a lengthy power vacuum and represents a pivot by Beirut toward the West, with Tehran-backed militant group Hezbollah weakened by last year’s bruising conflict with Israel.\nLebanon’s dollar bonds, which the government defaulted on in 2020, extended their big rally of recent weeks, as investors welcomed the sign of stability in the crisis-hit nation.\nAoun, who turns 61 on Friday, has led the army since 2017 and will be responsible for the daunting task of maintaining a fragile truce between Israel and Hezbollah while working on reforms to resolve a crippling economic crisis. First, he must name a prime minister to help shape the nation’s future after years of crises and isolation, typified by the default on more than $30 billion of Eurobonds five years ago.\nAfter being sworn in, Aoun pledged to strengthen Lebanon’s rule of law and security, saying only the state should bear arms — a reference to the military powers of Hezbollah. He also said he would work to secure Lebanon’s borders and focus on reconstruction and the economy.\n“We are living in a crisis of governance and of rulers,” Aoun said, urging lawmakers to work closely with him on what he described as difficult tasks ahead.\nIsrael severely weakened Hezbollah during an intense offensive by air and land lasting more than two months, killing the U.S.-designated terrorist group’s longstanding leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and depleting its weapons stockpile. That limited the ability of the organization, which is also a political party that holds significant sway in parliament, from sabotaging the electoral process.\n— Bloomberg News",
