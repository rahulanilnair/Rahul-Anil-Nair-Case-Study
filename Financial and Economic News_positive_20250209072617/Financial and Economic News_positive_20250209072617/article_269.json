US West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 73 cents, or 1%, to $74.05. Global benchmark Brent gained more than $1 during the session. Both benchmarks had fallen more than 1% on Wednesday as a stronger dollar and a bigger than expected rise in US fuel stockpiles pressured prices.\n“(Today’s rise) is definitely winter fuel demand kicking in here in the US for sure,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. Parts of east Texas up to the north of Kentucky were under a winter storm warning on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service, covering large swathes of Arkansas and Tennessee.\n“Right now it appears that the ice will stay north of refinery row along the US Gulf Coast, but power outages will be a concern as heavy rain and wind comes along for the ride,” TACenergy’s trading desk wrote on Thursday.\n“Yesterday we saw a strong refinery run rates, refiners in the US are clearly cranking out fuels of all stripes and that is also underpinning the crude oil market today,” Again Capital’s Kilduff added.\nRefinery crude runs rose by 45,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the week to Jan. 3 according to the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday, while utilization rates climbed by 0.6 percentage points to 93.3%. Refiners along the US Gulf Coast raised their crude oil net inputs to the highest levels since December 2018, the EIA said.\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan analysts expect oil demand for January to expand by 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) year on year to 101.4 million bpd, primarily driven by the increased use of heating fuels in the Northern Hemisphere.\n“Global oil demand is expected to remain strong throughout January, fuelled by colder than normal winter conditions that are boosting heating fuel consumption, as well as an earlier onset of travel activities in China for the Lunar New Year holidays,” the analysts said. The market structure in Brent futures is also indicating that traders are becoming more concerned about supply tightening at the same time demand is increasing.\nJPMorgan Oil prices Oil Comments 200 characters Print\nSBP governor seems very optimistic about economy Oil rises as cold snap drives winter fuel demand Indonesian President’s visit: Ministries asked to finalise trade proposals Govt wants to complete PIA privatisation this year FY26 budget: Tax, non-tax revenue: 4 base categories identified 20pc criteria violated: Q1 current expenditures stand at Rs3.54trn Large majority of committed power projects not affordable, says minister Revised IPP contracts: Govt says consumers to get Rs1.1trn benefit Telenor acquisition: Delay in CCP’s decision may impact 5G launch PIA sees Rs107m revenue on direct flight to Paris ‘Fake’ imports of solar panel: PCA unearths Rs106bn money laundering FBR rolls out new protocols for Afghan cargos Read more stories\nForex World Commodity Currency Rate USD PKR Interbank Selling / Jan 9 278.81 USD PKR Interbank Buying / Jan 9 278.61 USD to Japanese Yen / Jan 9 158.16 USD to Swiss Franc / Jan 9 0.91 Pound Sterling to USD / Jan 9 1.23 Euro to USD / Jan 9 1.03 Stock Volume S&P 500 / Jan 9 5,918.25 India Sensex / Jan 9 77,620.21 Tokyo Nikkei / Jan 9 39,605.09 Nasdaq / Jan 9 19,478.88 Hang Seng / Jan 9 19,240.89 FTSE 100 / Jan 9 8,319.69 Dow Jones / Jan 9 42,635.20 Germany DAX 30 / Jan 9 20,317.10 Item Value Crude Oil USD/Barrel / Jan 9 73.92 Karachi Cotton PKR/37.32 KG / Jan 9 18,785 Gold 10 Grams PKR / Jan 9 237,483 Gold Spot USD/Ounce / Jan 9 2,690.80 Cotton US¢/pound / Jan 9 68.50 Petrol/Litre / Jan 10 252.66 Gainers Losers Leaders Stock Price Next Capital / Jan 9 Next Capital Limited(NEXT) 10.49 ▲ 1.00 (10.54%) Ahmad Hassan / Jan 9 Ahmad Hassan Textile Mills Limited(AHTM) 59.90 ▲ 5.45 (10.01%) Dadex Eternit / Jan 9 Dadex Eternit Limited(DADX) 64 ▲ 5.82 (10.00%) Dawood Lawrencepur / Jan 9 Dawood Lawrencepur Limited(DLL) 325.73 ▲ 29.61 (10.00%) D.M.
