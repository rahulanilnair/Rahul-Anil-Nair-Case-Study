Zip2 became a unit of the search engine Alta Vista.\nPayPal (Formerly X.com)\n- Role: Following the sale of Zip2, Musk in January 1999 co-founded online financial services firm X.com with Ed Ho, Harris Fricker and Christopher Payne.

Musk reportedly invested $12 million into the company, which officially launched in December 1999. Former Intuit CEO Bill Harris served as the inaugural CEO.\n- X.com in March 2000 merged with rival Confinity, which was the parent company of PayPal. The merged company began operating under the PayPal name, with Musk as the biggest shareholder and CEO. In September 2000, the board voted to replace Musk as CEO in favor of Peter Thiel, who co-founded Confinity. The internet domain was changed to PayPal.com in June 2001. Musk repurchased the rights to the x.com domain in July 2017.",
