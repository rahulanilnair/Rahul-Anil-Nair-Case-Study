Maybe you have a bunch of apps that you don't worry about side-channel attacks with because you're not running in an environment where they're a risk, or they are trusted apps. For those, you might point them at different 'servers' that don't have the slower workarounds built in, and only apps that we worry about side-channel attack on need to use the slower servers with the workarounds!\nComment\n-\n-\nOriginally posted by zexelon[View Post](https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/phoronix/latest-phoronix-articles/1517708-redox-os-ends-2024-on-a-high-note-with-dynamic-linking-progress-ifconfig-port?p=1517806#post1517806)\nMost likely with a TON of research. Microkernels are very uncommon in the wild and I doubt any major security researcher has touched one yet. If you want to make fringe group name for yourself, studying this with the likes of RedoxOS and putting out a paper would probably put your name at the forefront of security in this niche\nPersonally I am super excited to see where RedoxOS goes and would also really like to know if there are any \"intrinsic\" security benefits to microkernels and this class of attacks.\nBut I doubt there has been much research into spectre etc for these. They are much less accessible to people not working in the field, they don't tend to run untrusted code (no web browsers), and for microcontrollers the CPUs tend to be simpler and may not even do speculative execution (just some very simple in-order super-scalar things).\nComment\n-\n-\n[Vorpal](https://www.phoronix.com/forums/member/113379-vorpal)yes this a fair point. QNX is probably one of the most common OSs out there outside of desktop/mobile operating systems given its usage in automotive where it has been proven to have some major security issues... but those were not side channel attacks in any way. Most of them were simply asking the TPS sensor to give you access to the whole car while saying please.\nI think the other major one is the L4 kernel.\nComment\n-",
