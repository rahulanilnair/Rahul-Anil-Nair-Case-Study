    "text": "TYLER, Texas â€” The economic outlook for East Texas is looking bright. That's according to economist Ray Perryman, who made the trip to Tyler Thursday.\nThe 41st annual Economic Outlook Conference, held at the W.T. Brookshire Conference Center, drew more than 1,000 attendees. Perryman addressed key topics like education, immigration, and housing development in the region.\nHe emphasized the critical importance of education, warning that while Tyler's economy is strong, a lack of proper education could hinder future growth. Perryman also discussed the population boom seen in the Tyler area, saying that is contributing to good business opportunities and more economic growth.\nPerryman mentioned the most important thing East Texans can do for future economic growth is to ensure their children are getting a good education.\nRelated Articles How the stock market defied expectations again this year, by the numbers Texas border mayor worries about mass deportations and tariffs DID YOU KNOW?
