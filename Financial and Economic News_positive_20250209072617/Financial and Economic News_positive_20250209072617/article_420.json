    "text": "Penn State is now the betting favorite against Notre Dame on Thursday night at the Orange Bowl.\nThe Nittany Lions have been an underdog all week, but are now -1 at most sportsbooks. DraftKings and Fan Duel even have Penn State listed at -1.5 (-115) as of publication.\nRELATED: Interested in betting on the College Football Playoff? Saturday Down South has you covered with a full breakdown of all you need to know to pick the right sports betting app for your needs!\nNotre Dame is reportedly dealing with the flu bug , so this late line movement could be related to that intel. However, it could also be unrelated. The spread in last week’s Sugar Bowl between Georgia and Notre Dame also flipped late in the week, with the Irish ending up as the favorite for that contest.\nThe closing favorite has won every game of the College Football Playoff so far. That includes Penn State’s previous 2 victories over SMU and Boise State.\nThe total for this game has not moved much late in the week. It’s held firm at roughly 45.5 points at most sports books, which is where it remains with less than 90 minutes before kickoff.\nPenn State and Notre Dame will kick off from the Orange Bowl at 7:30 p.m. ET on Thursday night.\nDRAFTKINGS SPORTSBOOK New Customers: Bet $5, Get $200 in Bonus Bets Instantly!
