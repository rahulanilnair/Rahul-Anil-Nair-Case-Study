    "text": "By Naomi Hillmer ,\n4 hours ago\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) — In an annual economic report to the governor, University of Tennessee’s Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research says we are in for steady growth in 2025.\nAccording to their recent findings, Tennessee’s Economy is projected to grow faster than the national average this year .\n“Economic growth in Tennessee has started to moderate, and we’re projecting that it’s finally going to start to see kind of a more stable growth path going forward,” said Larry Kessler, a research associate professor at the Boyd Center.\nAs the economy begins to stabilize in 2025, Kessler said there are still ample opportunities for growth.\n“We’re still at levels that are just way above anything we’ve seen in history in terms of economic activity, number of job openings, number of new businesses created. So, we’re in a really good spot, we’re just kind of seeing a tapering off in terms of growth,” said Kessler.\nBecause we are stabilizing faster post-pandemic, Kessler said we could expect more jobs, population and real-estate growth compared to the U.S. overall.\n“The more that our region grows as a whole and the more we’re economically healthy, the more it benefits everyone,” said East Tennessee realtor Maria McHale.\nWith Knoxville being named a top 10 housing hotspot nationwide by the National Association of Realtors , McHale said the housing market could be improving.\n“Both nationally and on a local level, we expect to see some improvement in the market for next year. And what improvement means to us is more inventory available, which hopefully leads to a little bit better affordability for folks, at all different price points,” said McHale.\nWith people continuing to move to Knoxville, both McHale and Kessler agree it brings more economic growth, and they say those who move here could be here to stay\n“From an economic perspective, there’s more people living in the state and living in the city, and they’re now contributing to the economy,” said Kessler. “They’re either buying more goods or services, which is also leading to an increase in potential job opportunities and also an increase in the number of available workers in both the state and Knoxville.”\nKessler added while we may not see as much job growth overall this year, parts of the labor force will grow, both in construction and health services.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
