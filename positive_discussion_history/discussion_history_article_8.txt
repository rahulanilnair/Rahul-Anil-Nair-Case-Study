DISCUSSION ROUNDS:

--- ROUND 1 ---

RISK_ANALYST:
  Stance: Partially Agree
  Proposed Sentiment: Neutral
  Proposed Confidence: 70%
  Proposed Impact: Medium
  Reasoning: While the current analysis highlighting XRP's resilience and growing adoption by major banks provides valid points, I believe a more nuanced assessment is required. The mention of a bull flag pattern and potential $15 price target might be overstated without further confirmation from technical analysis experts. Additionally, the impact of the U.S. Department of Justice's potential sale of seized Bitcoin should not be overlooked. Considering these factors, my proposed sentiment and confidence ratings reflect a more cautious approach.
  Key Points: Growing adoption by major banks, XRP's resilience in market chaos, Bull flag pattern indicating potential future price gains

GROWTH_ANALYST:
  Stance: Partially Agree
  Proposed Sentiment: Positive
  Proposed Confidence: 80%
  Proposed Impact: Medium
  Reasoning: I Partially Agree with the current sentiment due to XRP's resilience and growing adoption by major banks. However, I think the confidence level should be lower as the market is still volatile. The price target of $15 seems ambitious and may not be reached immediately. Overall, the analysis highlights potential growth opportunities in XRP, but more time is needed to confirm its strength.
  Key Points: [1, 'XRP's resilience amid market chaos'], [2, 'Increasing adoption by major banks showing strong signs of a potential comeback'], [3, 'Bull flag pattern pointing to a $15 price target']

SENTIMENT_ANALYST:
  Stance: Partially Agree
  Proposed Sentiment: Positive
  Proposed Confidence: 85%
  Proposed Impact: Medium
  Reasoning: While the analysis highlights XRPâ€™s resilience and growing adoption by major banks, I partially agree with the current sentiment due to the bullish bull flag pattern pointing to a $15 price target. However, my confidence level is slightly lower as there are still some uncertainties in the market. The impact rating is medium because while XRP has potential for growth, it is not a guarantee of high impact.
