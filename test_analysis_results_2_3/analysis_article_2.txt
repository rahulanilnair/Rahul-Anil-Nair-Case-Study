Rationale: growth_analyst: Despite the FDA approval, I believe the current sentiment should be positive due to the significant step forward for CureGen. Analysts remain skeptical, but this skepticism could be unwarranted given the novel treatment's potential. My confidence in this assessment is high due to recent market trends showing increased interest in biotech companies like CureGen after FDA approvals. While further scrutiny from regulatory bodies may impact the stock price, I believe the benefits outweigh these risks. Thus, my proposed impact rating of Medium accurately reflects a moderate effect on the company's stock price. sentiment_analyst: The FDA approval is a significant milestone for CureGen, and while analysts may be skeptical, the companyâ€™s novel treatment has shown promise in clinical trials.
