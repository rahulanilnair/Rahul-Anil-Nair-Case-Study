Rationale: growth_analyst: The article highlights the growing support for 'altcoins' from industry experts and analysts. The expectation of less regulation under Trump is a significant factor in their growth. Although Bitcoin's performance has been impressive last year, other cryptocurrencies are expected to perform better in 2025 due to reduced scrutiny and favorable regulations. sentiment_analyst: While the article highlights a positive outlook for altcoins in 2025 due to less regulation and favorable regulations under Trump, I partially agree with the current sentiment. The expert analysis from Citi and Andrew Baehr of CoinDesk Indices suggests that political support will strengthen the legitimacy of altcoins, but I have doubts about the extent of this impact. Additionally, I believe the confidence and impact ratings are too high due to the uncertainty surrounding regulatory changes and market fluctuations.
