Rationale: risk_analyst: The current analysis highlights the importance of community impact in the cannabis industry, and I partially agree with the sentiment. However, I believe that the confidence level is slightly lower than stated, as the article presents various strategies for businesses to increase community outreach but also acknowledges the challenges of balancing community input with business goals. Despite this, the overall positive sentiment on the importance of community impact in the licensing process is well-supported. growth_analyst: The article highlights the importance of community impact in the cannabis industry, and there is strong evidence that prioritizing community impact can improve business chances of getting licensed. However, I disagree with the current sentiment as it seems overly positive and doesn't fully acknowledge potential challenges and complexities.
