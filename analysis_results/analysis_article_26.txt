Headline Summary: Mexico inflation ends 2024 near 4-year low
Key Highlights: Mexico's CPI eased to an annual 4.21pc in December, driven by slowing agricultural prices despite increases in energy and consumer goods;
Final Sentiment: Positive
Confidence: 80%
Impact Magnitude: Medium
Agreement Level: Majority
Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: risk_analyst: The current analysis highlights a slowdown in Mexico inflation to a 4-year low. Although the energy and consumer goods sectors experienced increases, these gains were largely offset by declines in agricultural prices. The data suggests a possible interest rate cut in 2025. I partially agree with the sentiment but not with the confidence level. sentiment_analyst: Although the headline inflation rate is near a four-year low, I believe the sentiment could be more nuanced. The slowdown in agricultural prices was largely offset by increases in energy and consumer goods, which may indicate some underlying vulnerabilities in the economy. Additionally, core inflation accelerated to 3.65pc in December from 3.58pc in November, which suggests that some of the downward pressure on prices may be dissipating.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 2/3 agents agreeing on Positive sentiment.
