Rationale: growth_analyst: While the report estimates a significant growth in the artificial plants and flowers market, driven by increasing demand for decor, I believe there are concerns related to raw material price volatility that could impact this growth. However, AI-driven transformation is also driving market evolution, which can be seen as a positive trend. sentiment_analyst: While the report estimates a significant growth in the artificial plants and flowers market, I partially agree with the current sentiment that it will grow by USD 380.7 million due to increasing demand for decor and AI-driven market evolution. However, I have concerns about the volatility in raw material prices, which poses a challenge to the market. Therefore, my confidence level is slightly lower than the current confidence rating of 90%. The impact magnitude also seems reasonable considering these factors.
