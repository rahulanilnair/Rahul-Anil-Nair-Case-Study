Rationale: risk_analyst: The article mentions a diverse mix of sectors, including tech giants like Microsoft and NVIDIA, as well as retail leaders like Walmart and Costco. The analyst's confidence is moderate due to the lack of predictions for extraordinary growth, but the overall sentiment is positive due to the emphasis on steady performance. This cautious optimism and mix of sectors gives me reason to agree with the current sentiment and rating. growth_analyst: While the discussion highlights consistent gains among large-cap stocks in 2025, I believe there is room for improvement in identifying stocks with extraordinary growth potential. The analyst\u2019s confidence rating seems moderate due to this lack of predictions. However, the overall sentiment remains positive and supported by the diverse mix of sectors represented by these reliable investment picks. Market impact will undoubtedly still be medium-sized, given investors\u2019 notice toward these consistent performers. sentiment_analyst: While the current sentiment is positive, I partially agree with the analysis due to the emphasis on strong and steady gains rather than massive returns. The diversified mix of sectors among the mentioned stocks also adds to the reliability of these investment picks. However, my confidence level is higher due to the focus on consistent performance rather than extraordinary growth.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 3/3 agents agreeing on Positive sentiment.
