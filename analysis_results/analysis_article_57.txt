Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: risk_analyst: The current analysis suggests that AMD is expected to outperform NVDA in 2025 due to Nvidia's growing slowdown and AMD's strong AI server CPU business, but I partially agree with the sentiment as it overlooks potential headwinds for both companies. I increase my confidence level as the projections are based on analyst estimates and have a reasonable basis. However, I reduce the impact rating to medium as this is still in 2025 and there might be more volatility. growth_analyst: The current analysis is optimistic about AMD's outlook beating NVDA in 2025, citing AMD's strong AI server CPU business and upcoming MI350 series as key drivers for growth. The expert also highlights that AMD's valuation multiples are more reasonable adjusted for growth compared to NVDA. Additionally, the projected slowdown in Nvidia's growth and stabilization of AI hardware spending support AMD's potential for a bigger upside in 2025. sentiment_analyst: The current analysis presents a compelling case for AMD outperforming NVDA in 2025, with strong growth prospects driven by its AI server CPU business and upcoming MI350 series. The analyst's optimistic outlook is backed by improving fundamentals, such as record revenue growth and rising gross margins. While I partially agree with the sentiment, confidence, and impact ratings remain a topic of discussion.
