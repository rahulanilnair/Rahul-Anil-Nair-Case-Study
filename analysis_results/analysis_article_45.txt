Rationale: risk_analyst: The CEEMEA primary market is indeed showing signs of recovery with the recent hybrid bond issuance. I agree that these deals are largely a bull market product and indicate a market that is there for the entities it is supposed to serve. However, I partially disagree with the current confidence rating as 80% may be overly optimistic given the still elevated interest rates. Additionally, while the emergence of hybrids sets a promising tone for CEEMEA bonds in 2025, it is essential to consider that these instruments are riskier prospect for investors than regular bonds. growth_analyst: The recent hybrid bond issuance by Aldar Properties and Africa Finance Corporation indicates a healthy CEEMEA primary market. The emergence of hybrids is a promising tone for CEEMEA bonds in 2025. High demand for Aldar's hybrid bond and the planned issue by Africa Finance Corporation suggest that investors are willing to take on risk, suggesting a stronger market than initially thought. Additionally, the fact that these deals were able to attract big demand despite elevated interest rates is impressive, setting a promising tone for CEEMEA bonds in 2025. sentiment_analyst: The current sentiment on CEEMEA primary market showing rude health with hybrid bond issuance seems optimistic. While it is true that the recent hybrid bond issuance by Aldar Properties and Africa Finance Corporation suggests a market recovery, I partially agree as interest rates are still elevated and hybrids can be riskier prospects for investors. However, the emergence of hybrids in this context sets a promising tone for CEEMEA bonds in 2025.
