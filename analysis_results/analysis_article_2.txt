Rationale: risk_analyst: While safe-haven demand and potential economic impacts of Trump's policies contribute to the current positive sentiment around gold, I partially agree that the FOMC minutes suggest a more hawkish monetary policy stance could weigh on gold. Central bank purchases remain a positive force for the market, indicating a broader interest in gold as a strategic asset. However, considering both factors, I believe the overall impact is still high but with some nuance. sentiment_analyst: The recent positive momentum of gold prices can be attributed to safe-haven demand and market uncertainty around Trump's economic policies. However, the FOMC minutes indicate a more hawkish monetary policy stance, which could weigh on gold prices.
