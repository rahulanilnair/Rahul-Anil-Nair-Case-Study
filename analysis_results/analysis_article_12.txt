Headline Summary: Malta November Visible Trade Deficit Narrows 
Key Highlights: Exports increased by EUR 10.8 million to total EUR 509.0 million, while imports decreased by EUR 39.5 million to reach EUR 645.3 million
Final Sentiment: Neutral
Confidence: 78%
Impact Magnitude: Medium
Agreement Level: Majority
Rounds to Consensus: 1

Rationale: risk_analyst: The narrowing of Malta's visible trade deficit is a positive trend, but its overall impact on the broader market is moderate. The increase in exports and decrease in imports suggest that Malta is taking steps to improve its economic performance. However, the medium confidence level reflects my uncertainty about the long-term implications of this trend. The proposed sentiment of Neutral acknowledges that the news has a positive tone, but does not lean too far towards a specific direction. sentiment_analyst: The current analysis suggests a neutral sentiment as the trade deficit narrowed by EUR 136.3 million from last year, indicating a slight improvement. However, the overall trend shows a widening trade deficit in the January to November period, and the impact on the economy is still unclear. I partially agree with the current assessment, but propose a slightly more cautious approach due to the ongoing trade imbalance.

Discussion Summary: Discussion involved 1 rounds. Consensus reached with 2/3 agents agreeing on Neutral sentiment.
