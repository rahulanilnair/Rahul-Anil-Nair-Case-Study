Rationale: risk_analyst: Although the FDA approval is a positive development for CureGen, I believe the analystsâ€™ skepticism about high failure rates in clinical trials and biotech companiesâ€™ performance warrants a more cautious approach. The stock price surge may be driven by hype or anticipation of future updates, which could overshadow the actual impact of this approval. Therefore, I propose maintaining a negative sentiment, reducing confidence to 60%, and reassessing the impact rating sentiment_analyst: While the FDA approval is a positive development for CureGen, I do not believe it warrants a negative sentiment. The analysts' skepticism regarding high failure rates in clinical trials should be taken into account. However, the CEOâ€™s optimism about the treatmentâ€™s potential suggests a more neutral or even positive outlook with caution. The stock price surge could be driven by anticipation of future updates or hype, which might affect my proposed confidence level. Therefore, I propose a lower impact rating compared to the current medium impact.
