Rationale: risk_analyst: CureGen's approval is a red flag for the market due to analysts' remaining skepticism. This suggests a potential correction rather than a strong upward trend. Furthermore, biotech stocks can be highly volatile and subject to significant fluctuations based on FDA developments alone. growth_analyst: Although the FDA approval for CureGen is a significant development, I am skeptical about the long-term impact due to analysts remaining skeptical. The biotech industry is known for its high volatility and uncertainty surrounding new treatments and approvals. Therefore, I believe that CureGenâ€™s approval may not trigger a strong upward trend and could be met with skepticism in the market. sentiment_analyst: Though CureGen received FDA approval for its novel cancer treatment, the analysts" skepticism suggests a potential correction or uncertainty about its long-term success.
