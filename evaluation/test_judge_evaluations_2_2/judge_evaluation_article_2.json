    "rationale": "risk_analyst: While the FDA approval is a positive development for CureGen, I believe the skepticism from analysts outweighs the positive news. This suggests that there may be underlying concerns about the drug's efficacy or market demand, which could limit its potential impact on the stock price. Additionally, as a small-cap biotech, CureGen may be more vulnerable to market fluctuations sentiment_analyst: The current sentiment and confidence ratings seem too optimistic given the mixed response from analysts. While the FDA approval is significant, it is not enough to justify the strong confidence rating. Additionally, the potential market demand for this drug remains uncertain, which could lead to a lower impact on the stock price."
