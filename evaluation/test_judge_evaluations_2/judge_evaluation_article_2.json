The analysts' skepticism regarding high failure rates in clinical trials should be taken into account. However, the CEO’s optimism about the treatment’s potential suggests a more neutral or even positive outlook with caution. The stock price surge could be driven by anticipation of future updates or hype, which might affect my proposed confidence level. Therefore, I propose a lower impact rating compared to the current medium impact."
