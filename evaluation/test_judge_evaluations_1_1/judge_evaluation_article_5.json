    "rationale": "risk_analyst: I partially agree with the current analysis because while revenue growth is impressive, it indicates ByteDance's resilience in the face of regulatory challenges. Regulatory clouds remain a concern that should not be downplayed. A low impact rating seems suitable given the significant risks posed by ongoing scrutiny from Chinese authorities. Key points supporting my view include: The company’s adaptability and resilience are valuable positives, but oversight from Chinese authorities remains a significant risk. ByteDance’s revenues can still be impacted by increasing regulatory scrutiny, making confidence level too optimistic. growth_analyst: I partially agree with the current sentiment and confidence ratings because while revenue growth of 70% is impressive, regulatory clouds remain a concern that should not be downplayed. A neutral stance seems suitable given the mixed nature of this report. The company’s adaptability and resilience are valuable positives, but oversight from Chinese authorities remains a significant risk. sentiment_analyst: I partially agree with the current analysis because while revenue growth is impressive, regulatory clouds still pose an uncertainty that should not be ignored. ByteDance’s adaptability and resilience are valuable positives, but oversight from Chinese authorities remains a concern."
