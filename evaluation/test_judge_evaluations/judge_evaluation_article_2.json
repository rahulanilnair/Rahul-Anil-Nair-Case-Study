    "rationale": "risk_analyst: Although FDA approval is a positive development for CureGen, significant Analysts’ skepticism regarding efficacy and market potential must be considered. Despite this, the company has taken an important step toward regulatory validation, suggesting some optimism for short-term performance. However, substantial challenges remain, making a high impact rating premature.\n\nMain supporting points:\n* The FDA approval provides a boost to CureGen’s stock price and demonstrates progress towards regulatory validation.\n* Analysts‗ skepticism about treatment efficacy and market potential is a valid concern but not entirely dismissive of the company’s prospects. growth_analyst: Although the FDA approval provides a boost to CureGen’s stock price, I believe the analysts’ skepticism regarding treatment efficacy and market potential warrants a cautious assessment. The company still has substantial challenges ahead in overcoming competition and ensuring long-term performance. However, with this regulatory milestone achieved, I see some optimism for the short-term, making my proposed sentiment leaning towards positive but acknowledging the need for caution. sentiment_analyst: Although the FDA approval is a positive development for CureGen, I partially agree with the current sentiment as it acknowledges the benefits of FDA approval while also highlighting concerns about efficacy and market potential. The company still has substantial challenges ahead, but with this regulatory milestone achieved, I see some optimism for the short-term. Therefore, my proposed confidence level is 80%, reflecting a cautious but optimistic view."
