The more domestically-focussed smallcaps and midcaps declined 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively.\nThe Indian rupee weakened to its lifetime low.\nTwo analysts said foreign investors likely sold stocks, after data showed India’s trade deficit widened to a record level in November.\nWhile a quarter-point rate cut at the end of Fed’s two-day meeting on Wednesday is widely expected and priced in, markets are bracing for the central bank to scale back its easing in 2025 in anticipation of higher inflation under the Donald Trump administration.\nIndian market sentiment was bogged down by selling pressure as foreign investors waited for clues on further monetary policy easing by Fed on Wednesday, Sunny Agrawal, head of fundamental equity research at SBICaps Securities, said.\nIndian equity benchmarks slip as Fed rate trajectory worries hit IT stocks\nFinancials, the heaviest sector on the Nifty 50, dropped 1.44%, dragged by a 1.7% fall in HDFC Bank after the private lender received a regulatory warning alleging non-compliance with provisions for disclosures.\nReliance Industries - another Nifty heavyweight - slipped 1.8%, dragging the energy index 1.6% lower.\nIT firms, which get a bulk of their revenue from the U.S., dropped 0.5%.\nForeign investors net sold Indian shares worth 2.79 billion rupees ($32.87 million) on Monday. Data for Tuesday are expected later in the day.\nMonetary easing in the United States typically helps emerging market assets, such as Indian equities, as they boost foreign inflows.\nAmong individual stocks, Zomato ended about 1% higher after brokerage Nuvama said it expects the food delivery platform to see inflows of nearly $513 million when it gets added to the BSE Sensex on Dec. 23.\nIndian shares NSE Nifty 50 index S&P BSE Sensex Indian stocks Comments 200 characters Pakistan\nPakistan records $729mn current account surplus in November 2024",
