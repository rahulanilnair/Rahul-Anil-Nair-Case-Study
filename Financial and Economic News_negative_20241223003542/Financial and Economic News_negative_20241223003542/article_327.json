    "text": "I hope everyone had a merry and safe Christmas and was able to celebrate with friends and family.\nBut - was it a more reserved Christmas than it perhaps has been in the past?\nReflecting on the past year, people tell me life is not easy under Albanese.\nThis year, we need a government focusing on reducing inflationary pressures, increasing productivity and restoring opportunity.\nMore than a year on from the Voice Referendum, which diverted time from critical issues, one would have hoped the Labor government would have learnt, yet it's continuously failed to address key issues.\nThe Albanese government has allowed ideological pursuits to overshadow urgently needed practical solutions. Rising living costs, growing challenges in regional areas, and falling productivity all reflect a disconnect from the realities many Australians face. Despite their election promise of a government committed to transparency and accountability, Labor has been a government of non-disclosure agreements and lack of parliamentary scrutiny, with more than 70 per cent of bills passed in the past year guillotined from debate.\nRegional areas have borne the brunt of Labor's misguided policies. From banning live sheep exports to blocking the McPhillamys gold mine, these decisions cost millions in economic value and jobs.\nThe renewables-only approach to power treats productive farmland like a disposable chessboard, all while power bills continue to rise. The proposed biosecurity levy was a poor attempt to burden farmers with the cost of protecting Australia's food supply and was thankfully blocked after The Nationals fought for common sense.\nWater buybacks in the Murray-Darling Basin have been marked by inflated prices and a lack of transparency. An audit found the government department failed to manage the process effectively.\nWhen delivering actual projects, millions have been squandered on business cases that produce nothing more than paperwork, while critical infrastructure remains stalled. Delayed action on supermarket price gouging has only worsened the cost-of-living crisis.\nWe need a government that looks beyond the 'vibe', refrains from wasteful spending and focuses on revitalising our stagnant productivity and growth.\nWe need a government that looks beyond an announcement. It is one thing to say you will build one million houses, but if you don't have the land zoned and the infrastructure laid, nothing will be built.\nTo turn our fortunes around, we need to remove roadblocks to approvals, reduce red tape and simplify the industrial relations agenda to ease the burden on our vital small business sector. Put simply, we need to restore confidence in our private sector, invest in regional growth and focus on deliverables, not just announcables.\n- By Senator Perin Davey, deputy leader of The Nationals.",
