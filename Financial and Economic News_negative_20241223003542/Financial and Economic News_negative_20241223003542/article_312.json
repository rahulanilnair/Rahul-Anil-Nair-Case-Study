    "text": "Fees are increasing for many Delaware Memorial Bridge drivers. What to know. Jim Walsh Cherry Hill Courier-Post Show Caption\nHide Caption\nPortal North Bridge construction site welcomes the first arch: Video NJ Transit President Kevin Corbett during a press conference at the Portal North Bridge construction site to welcome the first arch on November 2024. Cash tolls will rise on the Delaware Memorial Bridge next year in an effort to drive motorists toward the E-ZPass system, the span’s operator said.\nThe $1 increase to $6 for passenger vehicles is to take effect April 1, according to the Delaware River & Bay Authority. Commercial vehicles at that time will pay an additional $1 per axle on the span between South Jersey and Delaware.\nThe change is intended to encourage bridge users to use E-ZPass, said Thomas Cook, the authority’s executive director.\nTaking a toll: It costs more to cross the Delaware on these spans\nThe increase will not affect rates under the New Jersey and Delaware E-ZPass program. That rate is currently $4.75 per car, the authority said in a statement Dec. 13.\nCommuter and discount plans also would not change.\nThe statement noted that other toll agencies, including the Atlantic City Expressway, are moving toward cashless operations “and the Authority needs to be prepared for that eventuality.\"\nE-ZPass users currently represent almost 80% of bridge users. The Delaware River & Bay Authority wants that figure to reach at least 90% of the bridge customers.\nThe toll hike is also intended to fund “an aggressive capital improvement program” in coming years, Cook said.\nA second toll hike would take effect “no earlier than January 1, 2027, and would affect all toll classifications,” according to the authority.\nIn addition to the bridge, the bi-state agency operates the Cape May-Lewes Ferry and the Forts Ferry Crossing.  It manages Millville Executive Airport and Cape May Airport, plus three Delaware airports.\nJim Walsh is a senior reporter with the Courier-Post, Burlington County Times and The Daily Journal.
