    "text": "about 1 hour ago • 2 mins\nFind out what happened in the markets today – and why you should care – with the free Daily Brief newsletter.\nWhat’s going on here?\nSouth Korea is dealing with low market valuations and governance issues, despite trying to boost capital efficiency and shareholder returns – challenges present even before recent political upheavals linked to President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment.\nWhat does this mean?\nKorean [stocks](/glossary/stock) have lagged behind their Asian counterparts since 2009, with consistently lower forward price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios compared to the Asia ex-Japan market. The 'Value-Up' program, introduced last February to enhance capital efficiency, hasn't matched Japan's success, where the Nikkei 225 soared 40% after new Tokyo Stock Exchange rules. The persistent 'Korea discount' is largely due to low return on equity (ROE) and weak corporate governance, mainly from the dominance of chaebols, whose complex structures often limit shareholder benefits. South Korea's tax setup, with a 50% inheritance tax and a 15% [dividend](/glossary/dividend) tax, also hampers market cap growth and generous dividends. In contrast, Taiwan's 1999 abolition of double dividend taxation boosted its market's ROE. Signs of change include share buybacks, like Samsung's $7 billion plan, and rising shareholder activism, as seen in Korea Zinc's governance overhaul under investor pressure. Still, a rapid market revaluation seems unlikely, with Japan's gradual governance reforms indicating impactful changes will take time.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: A slow and steady approach.\nInvestors interested in Korean markets should prepare for a slow journey, as structural changes, similar to Japan’s reforms, develop gradually. The ongoing low valuations and governance challenges suggest that patient investors may eventually gain if reform strategies succeed.\nThe bigger picture: South Korea mirrors Japan's journey.\nSouth Korea's struggles underscore the broader challenges economies face in balancing traditional corporate practices with modern shareholder-focused reforms. This mirrors Japan’s experiences, suggesting that even with policy changes, significant results may take time to materialize, reflecting a global [trend](/glossary/trend) where shareholder activism and governance improvements are crucial for market progress.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
