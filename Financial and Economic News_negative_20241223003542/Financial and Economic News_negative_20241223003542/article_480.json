    "text": "New Delhi, Dec. 17: India’s exports in November contracted by 4.85 per cent year-on-year to USD 32.11 billion, and trade deficit widened to an all-time high of USD 37.84 billion due to record surge in gold points.\nThis development follows after India recorded double-digit growth in exports in October.\nAccording to the commerce ministry data, imports rose by 27 per cent year-on-year to a record USD 69.95 billion in November due to high inbound shipments of vegetable oil, fertiliser, and silver. Gold imports during the month soared to an all-time high of USD 14.8 billion as against USD 3.5 billion in November 2023.\nCumulatively, during April- November this fiscal, exports increased by 2.17 per cent to USD 284.31 billion and imports by 8.35 per cent to USD 486.73 billion.\nTrade deficit, the difference between imports and exports, during April-November widened to USD 202.42 billion from USD 170.98 billion during April-November 2023.\nBriefing on the data, Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal said that fluctuations in oil prices are impacting the exports. Petroleum product shipments have declined by about 50 per cent to USD 3.71 billion last month. During the first 8 months of this fiscal also, these exports contracted by 19 per cent year-on-year to USD 44.6 billion. Barthwal added that non-oil exports are still recording healthy growth, and this along with services sector would help the country cross USD 800 billion of total exports by end of this fiscal.\nOn high trade deficit and imports, the Secretary said one should not be concerned about this as the country is growing. \"Therefore, our demand for imports will be higher. As long as ou exports and foreign direct investments are growing, it will finance our imports,\" he said.\nHe also said that the ministry is focusing on 20 countries and six services and manufacturing sectors including IT/ ITeS to further boost the shipments. In these 20 nations, there are huge potential to increase exports and to tap into that, the ministry is in touch with the Indian missions abroad.\nThe ministry is calling a meeting with these missions in January next year and \"we will be devising a strategy on how to improve exports in the 20 countries\", he said.\nAs per estimates, services export in November 2024 increased to USD 35.67 billion as compared to USD 28.11 billion in November 2023. These exports reached an all-time high of USD 34.31 billion in October, registering an increase of 22.3 per cent year-on-year.\n- With inputs from news agencies",
