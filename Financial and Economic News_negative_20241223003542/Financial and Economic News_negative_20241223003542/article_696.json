    "text": "In a compelling and fiery speech at the European Parliament, Sarah Knafo, a Member of the European Parliament, passionately argued for the creation of a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and spoke out against the European Central Bank’s push for a digital euro.\nKnafo highlighted Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, its fixed supply, and its growing global adoption as reasons why it should be considered by governments as a secure asset for national reserves, especially in times of economic uncertainty.\nKnafo pointed to the success of El Salvador, which made Bitcoin legal tender three years ago, defying political and financial critics.\n“Today, El Salvador has seen its investment grow by 100%, with hundreds of millions of dollars now available for its people, boosting their security and sovereignty,” she remarked.\nShe called on European nations to learn from El Salvador’s example and start building their own Bitcoin reserves.\nSarah didn’t hold back in criticizing the European Union’s economic policies. She also accused the EU of mismanaging finances, accumulating enormous deficits, and pushing inflationary policies that harm ordinary citizens.\n“It’s time to protect people from inflation and the bad economic decisions of our states,” she said, urging a shift away from the current economic system that she believes is failing the people.\nKnafo also expressed grave concerns about the potential dangers of a digital euro, warning that it could lead to a future where European bureaucrats can control or even ban individuals’ transactions with a single click. “This would be a totalitarian move,” she said, stressing the importance of freedom in financial transactions.\nHer call to action was clear: embrace Bitcoin, invest in the mining industry, and protect cryptocurrency holders from over-taxation. “Let’s dare to embrace freedom, stop fearing our own shadow, and stay true to the ideals of civilization,” she concluded.\nAlso Read: Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Could Surpass $16T Like Oil",
