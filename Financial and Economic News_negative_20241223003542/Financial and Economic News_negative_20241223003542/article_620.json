    "text": "Piazza Affari continues down to near two-week lows in a market that still favors profit-taking in anticipation of this week's central bank meetings, chief among them the Fed tomorrow. Weak signals are also coming from Wall Street where futures are traveling negative ahead of November retail sales data.\nIn the morning on the European front, the German Ifo data on business sentiment declining more than expected did not go unnoticed.\nAround 1 p.m. the Ftse Mib gives up about 0.9 percent. Trade just over 1 billion euros in counter value.\nFeatured stocks:\nEnergy stocks sold off, heavy across Europe. Among oil stocks, hurt by falling crude oil prices, Saipem loses 1.8 percent and Eni 1.6 percent after a swerve at the start of the session due to a technical error in order entry, according to a trader.\nAlso under pressure are utilities, which are suffering from rises in government yields. Hera loses 1.9 percent, A2A 1.5 percent.\nVolatile and with intense trading Telecom Italia is in the spotlight of traders after rumors of an interest of some funds, including Cvc, to acquire the share in the hands of Vivendi.\nThe telephone group's shares rose in the morning to gain more than 5 percent to 0.2888 euros, then reset gains and then rebounded to +1.5 percent. According to Equita, the rumors are plausible, with the most likely scenario being a share purchase by Cvc without a full takeover. Intermonte points out that the funds' potential interest in the 24 percent in Vivendi's hands \"opens up prospects for significant value for the company in the short term.\" However, it adds \"it is too early to draw conclusions in the absence of details on the price offered and how the share transfer might be structured.\"\nFerrari gives up 1.4 percent with some brokers citing the pre-closing call that the Maranello-based company's management held with sell-side analysts yesterday but offered no new indications on fourth-quarter trends.\nWorse is the banking sector whose Italian basket gives up 1.3 percent with Unicredit down 1.7 percent and Bper and Intesa down about 1.4 percent.\n(Andrea Mandalà, editing Stefano Bernabei)\nShare Go to the original article .\nLegal disclaimer Legal disclaimer\nContact us to request a correction\nBack © Reuters - 2024",
