    "text": "New Delhi: Indian stock markets witnessed a sharp decline on Tuesday as benchmark indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty 50 fell over 1 per cent each, weighed down by broad-based selling across sectors. The 30-share BSE Sensex dropped 1,064.12 points, or 1.30 per cent, to close at 80,684.45. During the session, the index fluctuated between a high of 81,613.64 and a low of 80,612.20. Similarly, the NSE Nifty 50 declined 332.25 points, or 1.35 per cent, to settle at 24,336. The index moved in the range of 24,624.10 to 24,303.45 throughout the day. Nifty Today: Top Gainers And LosersMarket sentiment remained weak, with bears taking full control. Out of all Nifty 50 stocks, only Cipla and ITC managed to close in positive territory, while the rest ended in the red. Shriram Finance, Grasim Industries, Bharti Airtel, Hero MotoCorp, and JSW Steel were the worst performers, with losses extending up to 5.27 per cent. The broader markets also mirrored the weakness in the benchmarks. The Nifty Midcap 100 index fell 0.57 per cent, and the Nifty Smallcap 100 index dropped 0.68 per cent. Volatility surged as India VIX, the index that measures market fear, rose by 3.31 per cent to 14.49 points, indicating nervousness among investors. Sectorally, all indices ended in the red except Nifty Media, which barely managed to gain 0.02 per cent. Major sectors like Banking, Auto, Financial Services, Consumer Durables, and Oil & Gas (OMCs) witnessed a decline of around 1 per cent each, adding to the negative mood in the markets.
