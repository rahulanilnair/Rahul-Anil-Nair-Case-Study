    "text": "Subject: ATY Lost Money on Hasbro, Inc.(HAS)? Join Class Action Suit Seeking Recovery - Contact Levi & Korsinsky\nNEW YORK , Dec. 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Hasbro, Inc. (\"Hasbro, Inc.\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: HAS) of a class action securities lawsuit.\nCLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Hasbro, Inc. investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between February 7, 2022 and October 25, 2023 . Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team:\nhttps://zlk.com/pslra-1/hasbro-inc-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=116807&wire=4\nHAS investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at [email protected] or by telephone at (212) 363-7500.\nCASE DETAILS: According to the filed complaint, it is alleged that defendants made numerous materially false and misleading statements and omissions about the quality inventory that Hasbro held throughout the class period, and represented that its rising inventory levels reflected outstanding and anticipated demand, rather than excess supply that outpaced waning demand. As a result of the foregoing, Hasbro common stock traded at artificially inflated prices throughout the Class Period and defendants' statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\nWHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Hasbro, Inc. during the relevant time frame, you have until January 13, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.\nNO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.\nWHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases.

Levi, Esq.\nEd Korsinsky, Esq.\n33 Whitehall Street, 17th Floor\nNew York, NY 10004\n[email protected]\nTel: (212) 363-7500\nFax: (212) 363-7171\nwww.zlk.com\nSOURCE Levi & Korsinsky, LLP\nNews published on 17 december 2024 at 05:45 and distributed by:",
