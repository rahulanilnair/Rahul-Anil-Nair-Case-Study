    "text": "A Margate man has admitted murdering mum-of-one Claire Knights.\nHarrison Lawrence-van Pooss, 21, appeared at Canterbury Crown Court today {December 17) via video link from Broadmoor.\nClaire, 54, was initially reported missing from the village of Upstreet on Wednesday 23 August last year.\nClaire’s vehicle, a silver Suzuki car, was recovered from Shuart Lane, St Nicholas At Wade. The artist is believed to have walked from there to Minnis Bay with her dog, where she is reported to have been seen later that afternoon.\nShortly after 7pm on Friday 25 August, Kent Police officers attended the scene between St Nicholas At Wade and Minnis Bay where Claire was found deceased.\nLawrence-Van Pooss had concealed her body, meaning Claire was not discovered for two days. A post-mortem concluded that her death was caused by blunt force trauma.\nAn insight into his mindset was given by the prosecutor that, after he murdered Claire, he took her dog to a nearby shop to buy treats for it. The dog was with him when he was later arrested by police.\nLawerence-Van Pooss also admitted one charge of upskirting of a different woman, which took place the day before Claire’s murder. After he was confronted and police were called, he went on the run.\nDetectives from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate arrested him on suspicion of murder the following day. He was then detained for assessment by medical professionals.\nOn September 18,2023, Harrison Lawrence-van Pooss was charged with murder.\nSentencing is scheduled for February 28th.\nNatalie Smith from the CPS said:“We hope that today’s guilty plea brings some small comfort to Claire’s family and friends, knowing that the man who murdered her has finally acknowledged and taken responsibility for his horrendous actions on that fateful day.\n“Now that the defence team have had the opportunity to fully consider whether Harrison Lawrence-Van Pooss had any mental health defence to the charge of murder, they have agreed with the prosecution expert witness that he does not have any defence available to him.\n“This has finally, after all these months of uncertainty, led to today’s guilty plea to the murder of Claire Knights.\n“Sadly Claire’s murder is a tragic reminder of the violence against women and girls which exists in our society today. At the CPS, our role is to bring the perpetrators of that violence to justice and today that has been delivered.\n“Our thoughts remain very much with everyone who knew Claire at this exceptionally difficult time.”\nA tribute issued by Claire’s family last year said: “Claire was a loving mum, partner, daughter and sister. An amazing contemporary artist, a trailblazer in life.\n“She loved animals and in particular, her Springer Spaniel, Zebulon.\n“We, the family, are struggling to come to terms with the fact she is no longer with us. We wish to thank friends and the community for their active support and kind words.”",
