    "text": "The number of professional job vacancies globally fell 8% in November as white-collar job openings in the US declined 17.6% month-on-month following the presidential election , according to recruiter Robert Walters .\nProfessional services bucked the wider trend, adding 7.2% vacancies versus the previous month, although India (-9%) and the UK (-6.9%) both reported declines.\nWithin professional services , the jobs most in demand globally in November were for procurement/supply chain (+19.6%), technology (+18.7%), consultant (+10%), accountant (+9.8%), and legal (+8.4%).\n“Lessons from the pandemic have driven professional services firms to adopt agile business models – which has allowed them to respond quickly to market changes, ensuring continued job creation even during economic uncertainties,\" said Toby Fowlston , CEO of Robert Walters.\n“The ongoing recovery from global economic activities, coupled with an increase in cross-border transactions, regulatory changes and sustainability and social responsibility mandates, has fuelled the professional services industry's growth as businesses navigate complex compliance and strategy needs.“\nBusiness Bulletin\nFinancial services accounted for a third of open roles despite a monthly decline of 11.7%, with jobs having increased 17.1% year-on-year.\nThe most notable month-on-month declines in financial services jobs were in New York (-16.3%), Singapore (-15.9%) and London (-15.5%).\nTech, media & telecoms, however, represents 37% new job vacancies following a 1.2% increase in roles from October, overtaking financial services as the industry creating the most available roles.\nWhilst the US dominates in this field, accounting for 40% of all vacancies from tech, media & telecoms, the drop off in November has been notable, with vacancies falling by -15.9%.\nIn contrast, there has been a significant uplift in India, with vacancies now hitting record levels at more than 6,000 jobs, which is 30% higher than October.\nProfessional jobs in retail, consumer goods & services dropped 27% amid continuing economic uncertainty, inflation, and automation as well as a slowdown in festive hiring.\nThe US reported the biggest drop in November (-32.4%), followed by Germany (-26%) and Mexico (-13.3%), while India (+65%), China (+47.6%), and Israel (+42.1%) bucked global trends in retail job growth, an indication of the growing prominence of e-commerce platforms.\n“November was a significant month for a number of reasons—not least because of the anticipated impact the US election verdict could have on companies worldwide.\n\"From trade agreements to regulatory changes, businesses are navigating an uncertain landscape,\" said Fowlston.\nTech and financial services represent the majority of professional job vacancies.
