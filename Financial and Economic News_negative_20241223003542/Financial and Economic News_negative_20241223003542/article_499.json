    "text": "Profit-taking comes as SBP cut key policy rate in line with expectations BR Web Desk Published December 17, 2024 Updated December 17, 2024 09:50pm Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Comments\nFollow us\nA volatile session was witnessed at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday as the benchmark KSE-100 Index fell over 1,300 points, but after it briefly crossed the 117,000 level early on in the trading session.\nA mixed trend was seen at the bourse with the benchmark KSE-100 Index hitting an intra-day high of 117,039.17.\nHowever, profit-taking erased all gains, with the index then hitting an intra-day low of 113,688.54.\nAt close, the benchmark index settled at 114,860.68, a decrease of 1,308.73 points or 1.13%.\n“The market witnessed extreme volatility throughout the day as investors digested the Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC) latest decision ,” brokerage house Topline Securities said in its post-market report.\n“Profit-taking gained momentum in the latter half of the session, amplifying volatility and further pressuring the market downward,” it added.\nSelling was seen on Tuesday in key sectors including oil and gas exploration companies, OMCs, power generation, fertilizer, cement, chemical and automobile assemblers. Whereas, buying interest was observed in commercial banks.\nIndex-heavy energy stocks including MARI, OGDC, PPL and PSO traded in the red, whereas banking stocks including HBL, MCB, MEBL, UBL and NBP traded in the green.\nThe market sentiment follows the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reducing the key policy rate by 200 basis points to 13%. This marked the fifth successive cut since June 2024 when the rate stood at 22%.\n“At its meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the policy rate by 200 bps to 13%, effective from December 17, 2024,” the MPC said in its statement.\n“Headline inflation declined to 4.9% y/y in November 2024, in line with the MPC’s expectations. This deceleration was mainly driven by continued decline in food inflation as well as the phasing out of the impact of the hike in gas tariffs in November 2023.\n“However, the Committee noted that core inflation, at 9.7%, is proving to be sticky, whereas inflation expectations of consumers and businesses remain volatile. To this effect, the Committee reiterated its previous assessment that inflation may remain volatile in the near term before stabilizing in the target range.”\nThe selling pressure comes as the market had factored in a cut of 200 basis points, and there were no surprises in the MPC announcement.\nHowever, on Monday , the benchmark KSE-100 Index had settled above 116,000 for the first time in history with a gain of nearly 1,900 points or 1.7% in anticipation of the MPC meeting.\nInternationally, Asian stocks edged higher and the dollar held firm on Tuesday as traders braced for a slate of central banks meetings this week that is likely to see the US Federal Reserve deliver a rate cut and the Bank of Japan stand pat for now.\nBitcoin, the best-known and the biggest cryptocurrency, remained nestled near the record high of $107,821 it touched on Monday.\nIn stock markets, Australian market was 0.75% higher, with Japan’s Nikkei up 0.26% and tech-heavy Taiwan stocks rising 0.5%.\nThat left MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up 0.18%.\nMeanwhile, the Pakistani rupee saw a marginal decline against the US dollar, depreciating 0.04% in the inter-bank market on Tuesday. At close, the currency settled at 278.27 for a loss of Re0.10 against the greenback.\nVolume on the all-share index decreased to 1,252.98 million from 1,470.66 million on Monday.\nThe value of shares declined to Rs62.72 billion from Rs66.63 billion in the previous session.\nWorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with 151.92 million shares, followed by Pak Elektron with 107.50 million shares, and Cnergyico PK with 58.28 million shares.\nShares of 470 companies were traded on Tuesday, of which 134 registered an increase, 297 recorded a fall, while 39 remained unchanged.\nMPC PSX KSE 100 KSE 100 index KSE100 index policy rate psx companies companies listed on PSX Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) SBP MPC KSE 100 companies PSX notice MPC meeting KSE index PSX stocks KSE 100 Index companies KSE 100 crosses 100,000 KSE 100 record high Comments 200 characters Popular Newest Oldest Ali Asghar Dec 17, 2024 03:07pm Beginning of correction has started until stock market reaches actual point, like 45k. thumb_up Recommended ( 0 ) reply Reply Shahbaz Dec 17, 2024 05:13pm @Ali Asghar, tomorrow it's going to be 1K positive.
