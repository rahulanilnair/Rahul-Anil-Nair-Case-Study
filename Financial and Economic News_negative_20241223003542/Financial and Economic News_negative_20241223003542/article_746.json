    "text": "The French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) has fined Orange 50 million euros, notably for displaying advertisements between the e-mails of users of its e-mail service, without their consent.\nOrange provides its customers with an e-mail service (Mail Orange). Following several inspections, the CNIL found that the company was displaying advertisements in the form of e-mails between the e-mails in users' inboxes.\nOn the basis of these findings, the CNIL considered that the display of such advertisements required the consent of Orange Mail users, pursuant to article L. 34-5 of the French Post and Electronic Communications Code (CPCE).\nThe CNIL's inspections also revealed that, when users of the orange.fr website withdrew their consent to the deposit and reading of cookies on their terminal, the cookies previously deposited continued to be read, in violation of article 82 of the French Data Protection Act (loi Informatique et Libertés).\nCopyright (c) 2024 CercleFinance.com.
