This is due to workforce restructuring and layoffs in FY24. Curefit slashed around 120 jobs in January 2024 in a restructuring exercise. These job cuts impacted workers across the company's brands like Sugar.fit, Carefit, Cultfit, among others.\nCurefit's operating income has increased by 33.6 per cent to Rs 926.6 crore in FY24 from Rs 693.7 crore in FY23.
