    "text": "Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) stock has stagnated since January of this year. There were bullish estimates at the end of last year, but most of the hopes have evaporated over the last few quarters. Even AT&T (\nVerizon: Lot Of Pitfalls Ahead\nSummary\n- Verizon stock has shown 20% YTD total returns, compared to 28% total returns by the broader S&P 500 and 50% by AT&T.\n- The Frontier deal will add to the massive debt load of the company and add to future uncertainty.\n- The EV to FCF ratio of Verizon is not very attractive when compared to T-Mobile and even bigger tech companies like Meta.\n- It is difficult to see Verizon stock beating the broader index in the near term, as the company has few growth levers.\nAnalystâ€™s Disclosure: I/we have no stock, option or similar derivative position in any of the companies mentioned, and no plans to initiate any such positions within the next 72 hours.
