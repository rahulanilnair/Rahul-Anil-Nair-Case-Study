There is greater fiscal sustainability and as I said, even the European countries are struggling to achieve some of these critical macroeconomic reforms.\n“This budget is based on government spending in critical areas, but also more importantly, encouraging and making room for private sector investment.”\nHe further stated that the improvements in the economy were encouraging. “For the first time in about 25 years we have domestic refinement of petrol, not just to produce petrol but also raw materials for industries across a whole range, from pharmaceuticals to building products to textiles,”\nthe minister said.\nfacebook\ntwitter\nemail\nTop Stories\nJarvis Opens Up Following Engagement to Peller (Video)\nPeter Obi Did Not Sleep Because Of Farotimi And Afe Babalola – Yunusa Tanko\nNobody Should Come And Tell Us Dele Farotimi Had A Cardiac Arrest Or Something Happened To Him - Kenneth Okonkwo Warns\nKemi Badenoch Should Renounce Her Father, Mother, Nigerian Lineage – Fani-Kayode Blows Hot\nWizkid Changed My Career – Singer, Terry Apala Opens Up\nPopular Stories\nFLASHBACK: Major Orkar's Speech In Failed Coup Against Babangida On April 22, 1990\nSome Very Controversial Pictures Nigerian Police Officers Don't Want You to See\nFor the Love of Curves: Delta-based Big Girl 'Rules' Instagram with Her Endowments (Photos)\nSee the Inside of Luxury 160million Pounds Private Mega-yacht Complete with Glass Elevator and Outdoor Cinemas (Photos)\nThings You May Not Know About University of Ibadan...
