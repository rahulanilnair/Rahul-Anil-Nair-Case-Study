    "text": "AngolaS 2025 Budget‌ Sparks Controversy: Opposition Highlights Hunger and ‍ Corruption Luanda, Angola – ⁣The Angolan parliament recently approved the‌ 2025 national​ budget, a €35 billion plan ⁣that has ⁣ignited a firestorm​ of debate. while the ruling MPLA party​ and the PHA celebrated ⁢its passage, the largest opposition party, UNITA , vehemently opposed the measure, citing ​deep concerns about its effectiveness and‌ potential for corruption.\nThe budget,totaling 34.63⁤ billion kwanzas, aims to improve family income,‌ living conditions, and ⁣national reconciliation. however, UNITA deputy leader Albertina “Navita” ngolo argues that these enterprising goals are undermined by inconsistencies in resource allocation.⁣ in a ⁤recent interview,Ngolo stated,”We understand,very clearly,that‌ the budgets approved by the MPLA Parliamentary Group ‍in the 22 years of peace…demonstrate a completely negative correlation to the goals set.”\nNgolo’s criticism⁢ extends beyond the budget’s allocation. She points to⁢ a history of ineffective implementation of previous budgets, emphasizing‌ that Angola’s most pressing issue remains the fight against widespread hunger.She highlights the stark reality facing millions of Angolans: “Let’s look at the‌ Angolan reality: 17 million Angolans are in poverty, 10‌ to 13 million Angolans are hungry. If I’m not ⁤allocating enough resources to the product departments,what diversification do I do? How‍ can ⁢I fight poverty and hunger? How can I combat 30% unemployment if I don’t invest in the⁢ private sector?”\nThe concerns extend beyond simple mismanagement. ngolo accuses the government ‌of allowing significant funds to flow outside official channels,a practise she terms “de-budgeting.”​ She explains, “However, there is a group of ‍Angolans who, through‌ corruption, through ​the transfer of large amounts of resources, from what is in the budget…a lot of money flows outside the general Budget of the State. The Government goes ​to Parliament and asks for this permission, but ⁤at the time of execution a lot of money circulates outside of this ⁣authority. And what⁤ was allowed to be done, to be affected, is done​ with‌ almost no effect on the life of the​ citizen.”\nWhile the MPLA claims the budget addresses the needs of the most vulnerable populations and points to increased investment ​in education and health, UNITA’s concerns resonate with the grim realities of poverty and hunger in Angola. The opposition party’s call for prioritizing hunger relief and addressing systemic corruption underscores the deep divisions and challenges facing the nation.\nThe debate ‍over Angola’s 2025 budget serves‍ as a stark reminder of the complex challenges facing many⁤ developing nations.The​ contrast between‍ stated goals and on-the-ground realities highlights the need for greater openness and accountability in government spending, a concern that echoes similar‌ debates about resource allocation and effective governance in countries around the world.\nControversial⁤ Angola Budget Sparks Debate: Examining Concerns about hunger, Corruption\nThe⁤ Angolan parliament recently approved the $35 billion 2025⁢ national ⁤budget.​ While the ruling MPLA party celebrates the passing of this economic⁢ plan, ⁣the opposition party ⁤UNITA speaks out against it, citing ‌serious ​concerns over its⁢ effectiveness and potential for corruption. ⁣ Professor Isabel dos⁣ Santos,an economist⁤ specializing in‍ Angolan advancement and governance,spoke with World Today⁣ News Senior Editor,Sarah Jenkins,to shed‌ light on the situation.\nJenkins: Professor ⁤dos⁤ Santos, thank ⁢you for ⁤joining us. can you explain the main points of contention surrounding ⁤Angola’s 2025 budget?\ndos Santos: certainly. While the budget aims to address critical areas like‍ poverty reduction,improving living standards,and national ⁢reconciliation,there are widespread concerns about ⁤how effectively it will achieve these goals. UNITA, the main opposition party, argues that the‌ budget allocation doesn’t match the stated priorities, and there’s a history of poor implementation of previous budgets.\nJenkins: UNITA’s deputy leader, Albertina⁤ “Navita”​ Ngolo, has been particularly vocal about this. What are her ⁢primary concerns?\ndos Santos: Ngolo points to the stark reality ⁣facing millions of Angolans:⁢ ⁢poverty‍ and hunger. She argues that‍ the budget doesn’t allocate sufficient resources to crucial sectors like agriculture and small businesses, which are essential ‍for ⁢generating employment and tackling food insecurity. Moreover, she criticizes the lack ​of clarity and ⁤accountability in government spending, accusing the ⁢ruling ‍party of allowing funds to “de-budget” –⁤ essentially flowing outside official channels through corruption.\nJenkins: Can you elaborate on the issue of ‘de-budgeting’? What does ⁣that mean in this ⁢context?\ndos Santos: “De-budgeting” refers to the practice of diverting public funds away from⁤ intended programs and ‍projects.Ngolo alleges that despite parliamentary‍ approval for specific spending allocations, a important⁤ portion of the money ends up ‍being channeled through corrupt practices, benefiting a ‌select few‌ rather than​ reaching those who truly need it. This ⁢lack of transparency and‍ accountability undermines public trust and hinders⁤ the country’s ​development.\nJenkins: ‍ How has the ruling MPLA party responded ‍to these ⁢criticisms?\ndos ‌Santos: ⁣ They maintain that the budget addresses the needs of the moast vulnerable populations, emphasizing increased‌ investment in education and healthcare.However, thier responses often⁤ lack concrete details and ⁣fail to ⁣address the underlying issues of ‍corruption​ and inefficient resource allocation, which ⁤Ngolo and other critics highlight\nJenkins: how common is this type of budgetary debate in Angola, and ⁢does it reflect wider challenges faced⁣ by developing nations?\ndos Santos: Unfortunately, similar debates around budget⁤ allocation, accountability, and corruption are recurring themes in Angola. This ⁤situation reflects the broader struggles many developing countries⁢ face ​in ensuring effective governance, equitable resource distribution,⁤ and poverty reduction. While angola has ‍made some progress in recent ‍years,‌ deeply rooted issues⁤ of corruption and lack of transparency continue to hinder its development.",
