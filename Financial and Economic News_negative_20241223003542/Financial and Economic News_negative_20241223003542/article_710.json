    "text": "Opinion As Lions hike season ticket prices 24%, this retiree can't afford them | Letters Detroit Free Press Tue, December 17, 2024 at 11:04 AM UTC 5 min read\nLast week, the Detroit Lions announced a whopping hike to season ticket prices — 24% on average — with some ticket holders reporting increases as high as 67%. The Free Press asked readers how they feel, and boy, were fans steamed. Submit a letter to the editor at freep.com/letters and we may publish it online and in print.\nI've held tickets since 1991. As a retiree, I can't afford this hike. I am extremely disappointed in the blatant money grab that occurred this year. I have been a season ticket holder since 1991. I scrimped in my 30s to buy tickets, and bought them religiously through the lean times when the team was terrible. Now I am retired and nearing 70 years of age, on a pension, and they are pricing my tickets out of my affordability.\nOver the years we have upgraded our seats but remained in the end zone to keep our ticket prices affordable (no 50-yard line for us). Last year my tickets increased 53%. I accepted that increase as they had kept prices stable during COVID-19 and some catch up was anticipated (20-30% would've been more tolerable). I was expecting this years increase to be more in line with inflation (3%-10%) . Imagine my surprise when my tickets increased another 37%, meaning that from 2023 to 2025, my seats have increased 108%.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement In the NFL there is a salary cap in place , so they were already spending this money on salaries primarily from TV revenue, so this increase was not required to pay players. This abuse of long time season ticket holders, it seems, is going right to the Ford family coffers. As they say, the rich get richer.\nI am extremely thankful for Sheila Ford Hamp's leadership, as she brought in experts (Chris Spielman, etc.) and hired Brad Holmes and Dan Campbell to lead our team. We now have a team that we can be proud to call our own — and they are trying to take that away from us by pricing our seats out of our hands.\nI am renewing for this year, but I may not be able to afford them much longer to justify the three-plus hour drive each way from Guelph, Ontario.\nKevin Gardiner\nGuelph, Ontario\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More From Freep Opinion: Winning ain’t easy: Letting go of a losing identity as a Detroit Lions fan\nDetroit Lions fans watch warm up before the game between Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers at Ford Field in Detroit on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Lions organization is out of touch with Detroit, Michigan It's amazing that the Detroit Lions organization represents the city of Detroit and the state of Michigan, but is out of touch with the concept of what is affordable to the majority of their fanbase.\nTo be honest, it's fine, though. I'm happy to not spend a ton of money to come to Detroit and go to games any more and stay home and watch the games on TV.\nSteve Bell\nLansing\nMore: With resale values soaring, Detroit Lions hike ticket prices on average 24%\nConsider the fans, not just your profits I have been a Lions season ticket holder for 43 years, and have been through an abundance of hard times with the Lions' production through all these years.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in Sports Chiefs’ biggest Patrick Mahomes dilemma isn’t his injury. It’s what came before it Miami Herald Joe Burrow's heated exchange with Zac Taylor goes viral Bengals Wire ‘We’re not brothers, he’s not my father’ – Ousmane Dembélé explains relationship with Luis Enrique Get French Football News LeBron James Reveals Why He Stepped Away From Lakers E! News Yet we still supported our team. I understand that we now are finally producing a winning team, but my euphoria is tempered by the unprecedented ticket hikes.\nMy tickets have doubled in two years. I understood that increases would occur, but what has occurred is astounding. While Lions President Rod Wood has an obligation to Sheila Ford Hamp to make her as much money as possible, perhaps the fans should also be taken into consideration.\nTim Ryan\nSouth Lyon, Michigan\nGuess Fords don't remember the year we went 0-16 How can they justify a 100% increase in the price of my season tickets over the last two years? I have had tickets for over 20 years. Retired now, so I guess regular fans are just getting screwed over. Pure corporate greed.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement I guess my faith in Shelia Ford Hamp was misplaced. I guess she forgot us when they went 0 and 16. I sure did not see any refund money from the Lions back then.\nWell, I hope they do it this year because I won’t see them next year. We are retired, and can no longer afford these ridiculous price increases.\nSoon to be former season ticket holder,\nMike Killian\nRichmond, Michigan\nReward fans, don't punish us Last year, the Detroit Lions had their best season in most fans’ lifetimes.\nRather than reward Detroiters for sticking with them for almost 70 years by keeping ticket prices the same, the organization raised prices last year by 30% .\nAdvertisement Advertisement That was a huge missed public relations opportunity by the Lions. They could have easily rolled in the extra revenue of sold-out games, jersey sales, extra concessions and TV contracts and spared the fans, but they did not. They stuck it to us. To borrow a baseball reference, that was strike one.\nNow we are in a position that we have never been in. More wins than we have ever had, national prominence and fans flocking downtown in droves.\nBut before we even sniff this year’s Super Bowl, they have already announced another nearly 30% price hike for 2025 season tickets. Strike two.\nDon’t get me wrong. The fans have been rewarded with a great team. Many of us have had the best Sundays of our lives, but we are now paying for it, literally.\nAdvertisement Advertisement I hope for continued success for our Lions, but I also hope that when ownership is given one more chance — one nice fat gesture, right down the middle of the plate — I hope that they don’t “ stand there like the house by the side of the road and watch it go by. ”\nBryan Chase\nHuntington Woods\nSubmit a letter to the editor at freep.com/letters and we may publish it online and in print.\nThis article originally appeared on Detroit Free Press: Lions' season ticket price increase slams fans who stuck it out\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 17,967 people played the daily Crossword recently.
