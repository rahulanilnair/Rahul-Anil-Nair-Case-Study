    "text": "Jaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty Images\nNvidia shares fell in premarket trading on Tuesday, as Broadcom continued its rapid surge higher.\nNvidia stock was down about 1.8% in premarket trading at 10:47 a.m. London time. On Monday, the company a entered correction territory — broadly defined as the point when a stock falls 10% or more from an all-time high close.\nNvidia hit its closing high of $148.88 last month.\nIn a tale of two chip stocks, Broadcom shares were 1.9% higher at 10:50 a.m. London time in premarket trade. Over the past five days alone, Broadcom shares have rallied 40%, while those of Nvidia have surrendered 5%.\nBullishness around Broadcom has been fuelled by the company’s release last week of fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations and a revenue outlook for the current quarter that beat forecasts. A number of Wall Street brokers, including Goldman Sachs, have raised their price targets on Broadcom’s stock recently.\nBroadcom shares have risen more than 120% this year to date, while Nvidia’s stock has added more than 160% over the same period.\nThis breaking news story is being updated.\nSource link",
