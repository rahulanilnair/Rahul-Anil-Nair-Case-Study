    "text": "eFishery, a prominent startup in the fisheries sector, has announced the suspension of its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Gibran Huzaifah, and Chief Product Officer (CPO), Chrisna Aditya, both of whom co-founded the company. This move is part of an ongoing investigation into alleged financial irregularities within the organization.\nAccording to the company, investors and shareholders have been notified about the investigation, which focuses on discrepancies in financial performance and revenue reports attributed to the two executives. Gibran and Chrisna each own approximately 9% of the company’s shares.\neFishery counts several high-profile institutional investors among its backers, including UAE’s 42XFund, Switzerland’s responsAbility, Singapore’s Temasek, Japan’s SoftBank, Malaysia’s Kumpulan Wang Persaraan, Northstar Ventures, and 500 Global.\nIn response to the suspensions, the company has swiftly appointed interim executives to lead during the investigation. Adhy Wibisono has been named interim CEO, while Albertus Sasmitra will assume the role of interim CFO, ensuring continuity in the company’s operations.\nThe investigation marks a pivotal moment for eFishery, as it seeks to address the allegations and maintain trust among stakeholders in its rapidly expanding business.",
