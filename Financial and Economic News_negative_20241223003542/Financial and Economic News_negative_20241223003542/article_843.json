    "text": "KARLSRUHE (dpa-AFX) - Energy network operators such as Eon are facing defeat before Germany's highest court. In the dispute over returns on investments, the Federal Court of Justice is apparently tending to agree with the Federal Network Agency, according to statements made by a judge at an oral hearing in Karlsruhe on Tuesday. Although a verdict has not yet been reached and the assessment may still change, the pointing of the finger is a damper for the energy companies that are challenging the interest rate decision from 2021 permitted by the regulatory authority.\nThe case concerns the determination of equity interest rates for electricity and gas network operators. The companies are bound by the interest rates when they charge grid costs. Grid users, i.e. households, commerce and industry, also pay the operators' returns via grid fees. While investments become more attractive due to higher interest rates, energy costs on the consumer side would rise.\nThe Federal Network Agency had set the interest rates for the years 2024 to 2028 at 3.51% for existing plants and 5.07% for new plants. A Düsseldorf court overturned the regulator's decision last year. The judges in Karlsruhe, however, have now strengthened the position of the Federal Network Agency and granted it \"discretionary powers in choosing the correct assessment method\". This should not be undermined by a court.\nIn reaction to the news, the Eon share price fell by more than four percent on Tuesday afternoon to its lowest level for more than a year. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on request, citing the ongoing proceedings. In principle, Eon would welcome a quick decision on the matter so that there is clarity, she said.\nEon is the largest electricity distribution network operator in Germany: at 32 percent, almost a third of the distribution network belongs to the Group. The distribution grid refers to all electricity grid levels below the transmission grid. The electricity distribution grid plays an important role in Germany's energy transition towards climate neutrality: almost all wind and solar plants feed their electricity into the distribution grid./lew/mne/mis\nShare Go to the original article .\nLegal disclaimer Legal disclaimer\nContact us to request a correction\nBack © dpa-AFX - 2024",
