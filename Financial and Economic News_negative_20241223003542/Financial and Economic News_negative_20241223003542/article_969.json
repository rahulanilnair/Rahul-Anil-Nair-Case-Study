    "text": "Wall Street is set to open lower on Tuesday morning, with investors digesting subdued consumer spending figures on the eve of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions.\nHalf an hour before the opening, futures contracts on the main New York indices are down between 0.3% and 0.5%, pointing to a session start in the red.\nUS equity markets have set a string of records since Donald Trump's victory in the November 5 presidential election, boosted by the prospect of tax cuts and deregulation in certain sectors.\nStill buoyed by the buoyant theme of artificial intelligence (AI), the Nasdaq set new all-time highs again last night.\nBut as the Dow Jones' recent run of eight consecutive down sessions shows, investors seem increasingly hard pressed to find reasons to buy after the recent 'rally' that saw indices rack up record highs.\nAccording to figures released an hour before the opening, retail sales rose by 0.7% on a sequential basis in November, a sign of the strength of domestic demand ahead of the festive season.\nExcluding the automotive sector (vehicles and equipment), however, retail sales rose by just 0.2% last month.\nInvestors will also be watching industrial production and business inventories figures, which will be released later this morning.\nThe mood is also one of caution ahead of announcements from the Fed, which could pave the way tomorrow for a slowdown in future rate cuts following its policy committee meeting.\nA quarter-point easing is almost totally on the cards, and investors will be watching the Federal Reserve boss's comments on the evolution of the institution's policy.\nTraders may be all the more tempted to play it safe ahead of the barrage of economic indicators that will punctuate the coming days, starting with the third estimate of Q3 GDP growth due on Thursday.\nCopyright (c) 2024 CercleFinance.com.
