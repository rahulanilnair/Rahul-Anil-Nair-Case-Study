    "text": "By Edward Segal ,\n5 hours ago\nNORTH DAKOTA ( KXNET ) — More than one in three parents say they’re skipping holiday traditions to save on costs this year.\nMost people consider the holidays to be fun, but they can also be stressful for people who have families and don’t have a lot of money to throw at food, presents, and decorations. The festivities can be hard to enjoy when you’re worried about budgeting your finances and making sure you’ll have enough money for everything.\nA parent’s financial obligations over the holidays can range from simply buying their child a present, to hosting their entire family, to traveling to another city or country for vacation or to meet up with family. The costs add up, especially when considering how much airplane tickets go for during the holidays.\nCardRates.com surveyed 3,000 parents from around the United States to find out which holiday activities parents worry about the most because of finances.\nNorth Dakota parents’ biggest worries, which align closely with the U.S. as a whole, are as follows:\n1. Holiday travel to visit family or go on vacation – The top financial worry for North Dakota parents over the holidays is the cost of travel. Airplane tickets aren’t cheap over Christmas, especially for people who live somewhere remote (such as North Dakota) and need a layover. When coupled with the cost of getting gifts for family members, this adds up financially.\nMinot Area Chamber EDC Cookie Drive looks to bring holiday cheer to airmen 2. Buying tickets to holiday shows – Holiday shows might not seem like that much of a financial burden, but they can be, whether it’s a Christmas pantomime or a family-friendly play like Elf: The Musical. If the whole family is coming along, costs multiply. When you add snacks and souvenirs to the list, this can turn into an expense greater than the parents anticipated.\n3. Buying gifts for children and extended family – Gifts can range in value, from video game consoles costing hundreds of dollars to more personal presents that don’t cost as much. These days, kids are more fascinated with high-tech toys and games. Parents having to buy gifts for their kids and extended family have to figure out how much they can afford to spend, while also not making it look like they favor one person over the rest by getting them a better or more expensive gift. The more relatives you have, the more you feel obligated to buy.\n4. Extravagant holiday meals or family gatherings – Adjacent to the last expense is hosting family gatherings and preparing meals for them. This is supposed to be a time when you don’t skimp, but that could reflect negatively on the bill, especially for families expected to cover everything since they’re hosting.\n5. Holiday-themed amusement parks or winter wonderland events – Going to an amusement park over the holidays is also not a cheap venture. Like holiday shows, these usually include concessions, drinks, and other purchases. This might be easier to plan for than some of the other expenses, but that doesn’t stop it from delivering a financial hit.\n6. Participating in school-related holiday activities – School-related holiday activities, such as shows and potlucks, are on the cheaper side of this list, but can also place a burden on parents. Whether it’s buying a not-too-cheap-seeming gift for the teacher or buying a costume for dressing up, costs can add up with each expense.\n7. Visiting Santa’s grotto or photo sessions with Santa – Visiting Santa might not be as expensive as the other entries on this list, but having personal photo sessions with him ventures into the deep end of expenditures. This one is easier to adjust based on what the family can afford, but who’s to say a kid won’t ask to sit on Santa’s lap in the mall unexpectedly?\nAnswering the age-old question: Is wrapping paper recyclable? 8. Ice skating at a seasonal rink – Finally, ice skating at a seasonal rink seems like a fun activity, but with admission fees, skate rentals, and potential concessions, these costs can add up just like amusement parks and shows.\nThe question then becomes, do North Dakota parents give in, or do they plan out their expenditures in advance to avoid going over their limit? The pressure to spend more is real, and setting those boundaries is not easy.\n54% of parents surveyed say they feel pressured either often or sometimes based on how much others spend on their kids for the holidays. 66% also say they either significantly or somewhat feel the need to spend more each Christmas to meet their children’s expectations.\nBecause of this, it doesn’t come as much of a surprise that 37% of parents have skipped a holiday tradition at some point due to its cost. Because of the pressure, however, 61% of parents admitted to feeling guilty for not being able to afford certain holiday activities or gifts for their children.\nSome parents have discussions with their kids early so that no one feels disappointed come Christmas Day. 34% of parents are fine with being upfront about their financial limits with their kids, while 49% say they set expectations ahead of time.\nCardRates.com reminds parents that though they might feel guilty for not spending as much as they would like over the holidays, being financially secure in the new year can make for a happier household.\nTo read the full study, go to CardRates.com .\nClose Thanks for signing up!\nWatch for us in your inbox.\nSubscribe Now\nToday's Top Stories Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
