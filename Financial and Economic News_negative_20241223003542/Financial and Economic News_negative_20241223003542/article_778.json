    "text": "(Article by Michael republished from\n[TheEconomicCollapse.com](https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/falling-off-a-cliff-this-chart-proves-that-we-are-in-a-major-economic-downturn-right-now/))\nWhen the number of job openings in the U.S. drops by 2 million or more, that normally signals that we are either in a recession or that one is about to happen. Well, as you can see from this chart that was posted by Bravos Research\n[on Twitter](https://x.com/bravosresearch/status/1866898241763283416), we are witnessing a collapse in job openings that is absolutely unprecedented…\nI was floored when I saw that chart.\nI knew that job openings were falling, but I didn’t know that things had gotten this bad.\nNot too long ago, there were about 12 million job openings in the United States. Unfortunately, here in the second half of 2024 that figure has fallen\n[below 8 million](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/29/economy/us-job-openings-jolts-layoffs-september/index.html)…\nThere were an estimated 7.4 million unfilled jobs on the last day of September, a drop from August’s revised tally of 7.86 million openings, according to new data released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The largest drop-offs in openings were in industries that have driven much of the job growth in recent years: health care and social assistance, and government, according to the report.\nMeanwhile, major employers continue to shed workers all over the nation.\nFor example, the U.S. lost\n[a total of 78,000 manufacturing jobs](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/manufacturing-sector-sheds-78k-jobs-last-three-months) during a recent three month period…\nThe manufacturing sector continued to shed jobs in October, bringing its tally of job losses to 78,000 over the past three months.\nThe Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday released its jobs report for October, which found that the manufacturing sector lost 46,000 jobs last month, according to the agency’s preliminary analysis.\nThat followed a loss of 6,000 jobs in September, which is also a preliminary figure, as well as a decline of 26,000 jobs in August.\nEvery day, there are more layoff announcements in the news, and the number of people filing initial claims for unemployment benefits increased much more than experts were projecting\n[last week](https://www.zerohedge.com/personal-finance/jobles-claims-explode-higher-first-week-december)…\nThe number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the first time jumped significantly last week (from 225k to 242k – well above expectations of 220k) – the highest since the first week of October.\nOn an un-adjusted basis, claims exploded higher (highest since January)…\nThroughout the second half of this year, I have been arguing that the U.S. economy is rapidly heading\n[in the wrong direction](https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/americas-middle-class-in-2024-aging-vehicles-300-carts-of-groceries-and-mountains-of-credit-card-debt/).\nNow we have even more confirmation that this is indeed happening.\nOnce we get past the holiday season, retailers are going to be dropping like flies.\nAccording\n[to the Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/yourmoney/article-14184085/Party-City-bankruptcy-mass-closures.html?ico=article_preview_xp_mobile), it appears that Party City could soon be forced to declare bankruptcy…\nA major party and craft retailer with 850 stores across the nation is considering filing for bankruptcy.\nParty City has been faced with the possibility of mass closures just a little over a year after the company surfaced from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nThe celebration retailer, known for selling balloons and essential party supplies, is currently behind on rent at some of its locations, people close to the matter told Bloomberg.\nAnd it is being reported that 670 Family Dollar stores\n[have already been shut down](https://www.costar.com/article/414594609/dollar-tree-has-closed-nearly-700-of-its-poorly-performing-family-dollar-stores)…\nDiscount behemoth Dollar Tree has shuttered 670 of its underperforming Family Dollar stores so far, about two-thirds of the nearly 1,000 it plans to close, as it considers whether to sell or spin off the struggling chain.\nThe Chesapeake, Virginia-based retailer provided an update on its portfolio optimization efforts when it reported is fiscal third-quarter earnings. Dollar Tree officials also said they were still reviewing options for Family Dollar, with no set deadline or timeline to complete that process.\nOverall, thousands upon thousands of retail stores in the U.S. have been shuttered in 2024, and thousands upon thousands will be shuttered in 2025.\nIn many areas of the country, the landscape is absolutely littered with once thriving businesses that have now been boarded up.\nMore than a decade ago, I warned\n[that we were headed for a future](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Michael-Snyder/author/B01DUPOJL2) when impoverished areas of the U.S. would be filled with boarded up businesses and abandoned buildings.\nNow we are there.\nOn top of everything else, inflation is starting to surge once again, and one recent survey discovered that about a third of all U.S. households have been forced to cut back spending\n[just to keep the lights on](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/electricity-bill-americans-struggle-to-pay-lendingtree/)…\nWith the cost of things like food and housing still straining people’s budgets, many U.S. households over the past year have found themselves having to pare their spending on basic necessities just to keep the lights on at home.\nThat’s according to a recent Lending Tree study which analyzed U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey data from Aug. 20, 2024 to Sep. 16, 2024 to find the percentage of Americans 18 and older that had cut back on necessary expenses to pay their energy bill, kept their home at an unsafe or unhealthy temperature, or was unable to pay the full amount on an energy bill at least once over the preceding 12 months.\nThe study found that more than 34% of respondents said they have had to cut back or skip spending on certain necessary expenses at least once over the past year in order to pay their energy bill.\nAs I discussed\n[the other day](https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wef-survey-shows-that-business-leaders-are-deeply-concerned-that-a-global-recession-is-coming/#google_vignette), prior to the election most Americans believed that we were already in a recession.\nSince the election, conditions have only gotten worse.\nMany are hoping that our economic momentum can be reversed once the new administration takes over.\nWe should all be hoping that is true.\nBut right now we are on a freight train that is steamrolling in the wrong direction, and that is not good news at all.\nRead more at:\n[TheEconomicCollapse.com](https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/falling-off-a-cliff-this-chart-proves-that-we-are-in-a-major-economic-downturn-right-now/)",
