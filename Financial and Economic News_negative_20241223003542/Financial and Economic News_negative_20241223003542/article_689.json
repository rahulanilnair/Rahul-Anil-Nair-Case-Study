    "text": "By Mariah Ellis ,\n33 minutes ago\nFOUR OAKS, N.C. (WNCN) — When he’s not riding his dirt bike, Marley Joyner said he loves fixing and repairing them.\nThe 20-year-old from Four Oaks said he’s worked on motorbikes for the last seven years. About a year ago, he started his own business.\nJoyner said just a few days ago, his shop took a major hit.\n“I woke up and I came out outside, and the first thing I noticed was that the bike was missing off of the trailer,” said Joyner.\nJoyner, who lives next to his shop, said he went outside early Thursday morning and noticed the dirt bikes inside were missing. Altogether, he said someone took seven dirt bikes and one four-wheeler. He said it’s amounted to about a $30,000 loss.\n“They broke in right through here, pulled the side, and went through and unlocked the door,” said Joyner. He pointed to the back wall of the shop that had been pried open. Joyner also walked toward the footprints and tire marks that made him believe the bikes were rolled down the hill at the back of the property.\n“He lost it, and he just started crying,” said Joyner’s mother, Ashley Henry. She said the hit was even more difficult knowing how much her son’s work meant.\n“This has been his dream … It’s grown, you know? And then all of a sudden in one night it was all taken away from him,” said Henry.\nThe family said it likely happened when people were home. Joyner said no one heard a sound, including their neighbors.\nThe business, MJ Powersports, wasn’t the only property hit. Joyner mentioned a neighbor also reported a stolen dirt bike about three weeks earlier.\nThe family said another home about a mile away off of US 301 was also impacted that same night that they lost the bikes. They said someone stole two pistols from vehicles as well as a debit card that was used for about $12,000 on Visa gift cards.\nThe Johnston County Sheriff’s Office said they’re investigating the recent incidents. While they confirmed an uptick in stolen motorbikes, they don’t believe any of the crimes are connected at this point; however, deputies said they’re not ruling it out.\n“Where are these bikes going?” questioned Joyner. “They’re going around and taking other people’s stuff that we worked hard for.”\nThe family said they’ve reached out not just to neighbors, but also many more across social media. They not only want to let others know of the recent theft, but they’re also hopeful someone may recognize the bikes.\nWhile some of the dirt bikes were projects of his own, Joyner said he’s working to replace the loss for his customers.\n“It’s going to probably take another year to get back to where I was, at least. And then the customers … It’s not fair for them because they weren’t in possession. I have to pay them back — that’s the only right thing to do,” said Joyner.\nThe family recently started a GoFundMe page to support Joyner and the shop’s loss.\nAnyone with information is asked to reach out to the Johnston County Sheriff’s Office.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
