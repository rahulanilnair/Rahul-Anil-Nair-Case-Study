    "text": "According to the daily charts, this exchange-traded fund with a high dividend yield of 3.67% has been under pressure as it has fallen below its short-term moving averages in the oversold territory.\nWhat Happened: Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF SCHD , which has an expense ratio of 0.06% and pays an annual dividend of $1.05 has declined 3.20% over the last month, as of Monday’s close. The ETF made its last dividend payment on Dec. 16, for the current year.\nFrom a technical perspective, the analysis of daily moving averages indicates that the ETF may be under pressure in the short term.\nThe ETF ended at $27.87 apiece on Monday. This was below its eight and 20-day simple moving averages, of $28.30 and $28.82, respectively. As per Benzinga Pro data , its current price was also lower than the 50-day moving average at $28.65.\nHowever, the stock was above its 200-day moving average of $27.15, which implies that it could still be in a long-term uptrend while it is testing fresh support levels near the average value.\nThis trend combined with a relative strength index of 31.22 could mean that the ETF must be experiencing a bearish short-term trend but a price reversal is possible as it is near the oversold levels.\nThere is a possibility that the ETF is taking a breather and it could stage a strong comeback. Historically, stocks and other assets often retreat after rising to a crucial level and then bounce back.\nSee Also: Elon Musk’s Tesla Nearly 5 Times More Expensive Than Industry Average: Stock Surges Over 60% Since Election\nWhy It Matters: When compared to its peers, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has the highest dividend yield for the least amount of expense ratio, according to Nasdaq’s data .\nDividend ETFs Expense Ratio Dividend Yield Annual Dividend Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF SCHD 0.06% 3.67% $1.058 Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares VYM 0.06%\n2.58% $3.404 iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF DGRO 0.08% 2.54% $1.6123 iShares Core High Dividend ETF HDV\n0.08% 4.23% $4.9179 SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY 0.35% 2.27% $3.1408 Source: Nasdaq However, on a year-to-date basis, Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF has the poorest performance when compared to its peers.\nDividend ETFs YTD Performance Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF 9.04% Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares 17.32% iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF 17.14% iShares Core High Dividend ETF 10.77% SPDR S&P Dividend ETF 9.44% Source: Google Finance Read Next:\nGold Poised For Its Best Year In A Decade While Bitcoin Surges: Analysts Eye 2025 As A Golden Era For Precious Metal Amid Michael Saylor's Push For BTC As A Reserve Asset Image Via Shutterstock\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs © 2024 Benzinga.com.
