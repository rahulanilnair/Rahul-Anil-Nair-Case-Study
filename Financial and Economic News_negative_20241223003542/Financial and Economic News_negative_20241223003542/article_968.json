    "text": "Earlier, the DGCA issued a show-cause notice to one of Akasa Air's aircraft maintenance engineers after finding 'poor maintenance standards and certification' and 'lapses' during a spot check.\nSesa Sen @Sesa Sen\n17 Dec 2024, 07:44 PM IST 17 Dec 2024, 07:44 PM IST 17 Dec 2024, 07:44 PM IST WhatsApp X (was Twitter) Facebook Telegram Save\nThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation has slapped a second show-cause notice on Akasa Air in less than a month over alleged violation of operations manual norms (Photo source: Akasa Air/X) The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has slapped a second show-cause notice on Akasa Air in less than a month over alleged violation of operations manual norms, according to people aware of the matter.\nBased on the submissions of SNV Aviation Pvt., which runs Akasa Air, the DGCA found that the airline's operations manual revision cycle surpassed the six-month timeline. This delay is in violation of specific provisions outlined in the Civil Aviation Requirements, they told NDTV Profit on the condition of anonymity.\nThe show-cause notice also states that the director of flight operations for the airline failed to ensure compliance with the CAR. The aviation safety regulator has given 15 days to the airline to respond, they said.\nResponding to NDTV Profit's query on the notice, an Akasa Air spokesperson said the DGCA \"raised certain findings, for which they have issued a notice for clarification from Akasa Air's flight operations team\".\nThe airline is \"working closely with the DGCA\" to clarify this issue and enhance its operational protocols as required by the regulator, the spokesperson said in a statement. \"Safety is of utmost importance, and we continuously strive to pursue the highest standards of safety.\"\nDays ago, the regulator issued a show-cause notice to one of Akasa Air's aircraft maintenance engineers after finding \"poor maintenance standards and certification\" and \"lapses\" during a spot check at the Bengaluru airport.\n\"During the spot check by this office on 30.08.2024 at KIAL airport, Bangalore it was observed that the right-hand nose wheel tire pressure indicator system sensor on aircraft VT-YAY was re-installed by certifying staff... He had failed to do the positive locking of the system's sensor,\" the DGCA said in the show-cause notice dated Dec. 9.\nThe Rakesh Jhunjhunwala family-invested airline has been under intense scrutiny regarding its compliance. In October, the regulator also imposed a fine of Rs 30 lakh on Akasa Air for certain lapses in pilot training following a spot audit in May and a subsequent show-cause notice issued in August.\nThe newest entrant in the aviation market is also facing a pushback from its own pilots. A group of Akasa Air pilots wrote to the Civil Aviation Minister, K Rammohan Naidu on Dec. 11 seeking an independent probe into the airline's management practice, training methods, and safety standards. Alleging unfair training practices, harassment, and safety concerns, they stated that 84 pilots resigned on a one-day notice. The airline has, however, categorically denied these allegations.\nALSO READ Akasa Air's Loss Widens To Rs 1,670.06 Crore In FY24 Opinion Akasa Air's Loss Widens To Rs 1,670.06 Crore In FY24 Read More",
