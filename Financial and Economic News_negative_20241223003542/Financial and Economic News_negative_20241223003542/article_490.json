    "text": "Indian markets closed in the red on Tuesday for the second consecutive day in a row. The BSE Sensex fell more than 1,000 points while the Nifty50 closed below 24,400 levels. Sectorally, selling was seen in oil & gas, auto, metal, and telecom stocks. Stocks that hit fresh highs include names like DOMS Industries which rose more than 4%, Oberoi Realty closed with gains of nearly 3% and Paytm closed nearly 1% higher on Tuesday. We spoke to an analyst on how one should look at these stocks the next trading day entirely from an educational point of view: Analyst: Priyanka Limaye, CA, CMT This stock has been steadily making higher highs and higher lows for the past few days. 3100 is a strong technical hurdle.If it manages to stay above this level, then 3250 and 3380 would be the next two higher targets, respectively.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and other technical indicators are yet to show upward momentum. The volume in Tuesday’s session was good. Support now stands at 2900. Recently, this stock gave a consolidation breakout from the 1650-2050 zone. The 2350-2450 band is again a strong resistance zone.If it manages to sustain above 2450, then 2700 and 2950 would be highly likely upside targets. RSI has entered the super bullish zone. Support now stands at 2200. This stock has been moving upwards for many weeks. 1000 is a technical hurdle, and for the last two days, it has been sustaining above this mark.Today’s candle is slightly bearish. If it remains above 1000, then 1150 and 1250 would be two possible higher targets. RSI has entered the super bullish zone.
