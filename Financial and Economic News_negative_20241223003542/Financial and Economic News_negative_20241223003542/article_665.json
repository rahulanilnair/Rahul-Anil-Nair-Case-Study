    "text": "The UK government is prepared to slash nearly 10,000 civil service posts as Whitehall departments are under increasing pressure to cut spending in line with new [fiscal](https://uk.whatjobs.com/dtl__cpl?utm_campaign=publisher&utm_medium=text_link&utm_source=5770&keyword=fiscal&location=) efficiency goals.\nThis decision follows Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ request to ministries to discover 5 percent savings in their budgets during an ongoing spending review.\nRising Civil Service Numbers\nThe civil service employment currently stands at 513,000, a significant rise from 380,000 in 2016.\nThis expansion was fuelled by the demands of Brexit and the COVID-19 epidemic, which required additional [workers ](https://uk.whatjobs.com/dtl__cpl?utm_campaign=publisher&utm_medium=text_link&utm_source=5770&keyword=workers-&location=)to handle the tremendous workload.\nMinisters now say the civil service is too bloated and has to be streamlined.\nTo fulfil financial restrictions, departments would have to make “very hard choices” over staffing, according to a Cabinet Office source.\nVoluntary redundancies, redeployment, and a recruiting freeze are among the measures under consideration to cut personnel numbers.\nNeed Career Advice?

Visit [whatjobs.com](http://www.whatjobs.com/) today\nUnion and Expert Reactions\nThe job cuts have sparked concern among trade unions and civil service advocates:\n- Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, urged the government to work collaboratively with civil servants and unions to develop a clear workforce strategy.\n- Alex Thomas of the Institute for Government argued against fixed headcount targets, highlighting the risk of “perverse incentives” leading to the loss of lower-paid staff rather than\n[strategic](https://uk.whatjobs.com/dtl__cpl?utm_campaign=publisher&utm_medium=text_link&utm_source=5770&keyword=strategic&location=)efficiency improvements.\nCivil staff have also criticised the proposed cuts, citing Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s previous remarks about a “tepid bath of managed decline” in Whitehall.\nDave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union for senior government workers, described Starmer’s views as “frankly insulting.”\nHiring?

However, the cuts risk lowering morale among staff already grappling with tighter budgets and criticism of performance.\nNeed Career Advice? [Get employment skills advice at all levels of your career](https://www.whatjobs.com/info/career-advice/?utm_medium=npost&utm_source=whatnews&utm_campaign=internallinks)\nLooking Ahead\nWhile the government insists that these reductions will make the civil service “more efficient and effective,” concerns remain over how these changes will impact [service](https://uk.whatjobs.com/dtl__cpl?utm_campaign=publisher&utm_medium=text_link&utm_source=5770&keyword=service&location=) delivery and the long-term functioning of Whitehall.\nThe strategic workforce plan will play a vital role in determining how the civil service evolves to meet the demands of a modern government.",
