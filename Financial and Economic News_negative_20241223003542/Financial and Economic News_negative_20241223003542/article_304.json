    "text": "Oil prices were down on Tuesday as China's economic data renewed demand concerns, while investors remained cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve's interest rate decision.\nBrent crude futures eased 32 cents to $73.59 a barrel at 0949 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate crude was down 44 cents at $70.27 a barrel.\nPrices were \"weighed on by profit-taking after last week's 6 per cent rally and a batch of disappointing Chinese economic data yesterday,\" IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said.\nOn Monday, prices fell from multi-week highs on unexpected weakness in consumer spending data from China, despite strength in industrial output, and as investors moved into a holding pattern ahead of the Fed's meeting.\n The Fed will hold its last policy meeting of the year on Tuesday and Wednesday, where it is widely expected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.\nThe meeting will also shed light on how much further officials think they will cut interest rates in 2025 and 2026, and whether the central bank will scale back easing in anticipation of higher inflation under the incoming Trump administration.\nMore From This Section Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sees $76 bn wealth surge, trails Musk, Zuckerberg Why are 70,000 Chinese electric vehicles clogging the Brazilian port?

Answer to stopping tragedy is to reach ceasefire: US on Israel-Hamas \"A 25 basis point cut has already been priced in by the market, so any surprises (from the Fed meeting) may move the market,\" said Anh Pham, a LSEG analyst.\nLower interest rates can boost economic growth and demand for oil.\nThe oil market for next year could be affected by growing supplies from non-OPEC+ countries such as the US and Brazil and slowing demand, chiefly in China.\nThe International Energy Agency said in its monthly report last week that even as producer group OPEC+ kept its output cuts in place, there will be a supply overhang of 950,000 barrels per day next year - almost 1 per cent of world supply.\nOn Monday, the European Commission announced a 15th package of EU sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, including tougher measures against Chinese entities and more vessels from Moscow's so-called \"shadow fleet\" that are not regulated or insured by conventional Western providers.\nA group of Western countries will begin to check insurance documents of Russia's shadow fleet of vessels in the English Channel, Danish straits, Gulf of Finland and the sound between Sweden and Denmark.\nThe new EU sanctions are unlikely to translate to \"real\" disruption as most flows now do not use Western services, so they will not be disrupted, said LSEG's Pham.\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nAlso Read Opec+ agrees to delay oil hike plans until April, extends cuts into 2026 Govt pins growth hopes on Trump keeping crude prices low: CEA Nageswaran PM Modi visits Guyana: Why South American nation is crucial to India Crude oil to remain volatile in Samvat 2081 amid OPEC+ production cuts Crude Oil: Here's your trading strategy for October 17; target price & more Topics : crude oil production Oil production US Fed Interest Rates Don't miss the most important news and views of the day.
