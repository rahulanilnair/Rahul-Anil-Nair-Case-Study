    "text": "Down start in Piazza Affari, in line with the weak opening of European stock markets, amid a very cautious market awaiting central bank meetings coming up this week, foremost among them the Fed tomorrow. Attention in Europe is also focused on the political crisis in Germany where parliament yesterday challenged Chancellor Olaf Scholz, paving the way for early elections in February.\nAround 9:35 a.m. the Ftse Mib retreats 0.73 percent.\nIn a list dotted with negative signs, sales are concentrated more on energy. Eni loses 1.3 percent after an early thud of more than 6 percent caused, according to one trader, by a technical error in order entry.\nAlso down are Saipem (-1.8%) and Tenaris (-1.5%), with weakness also affecting the entire utility sector.\nAmong the few positive cues Telecom Italia rises more than 3 percent continuing the rally triggered yesterday afternoon on rumors, reported by Bloomberg, that the Cvc fund is in preliminary talks with Vivendi to acquire its 24 percent stake in Tim.\n(Andrea Mandalà, editing Francesca Piscioneri)\nShare Go to the original article .\nLegal disclaimer Legal disclaimer\nContact us to request a correction\nBack © Reuters - 2024",
