To State Assembly Incessant Power Outage: Abia Sends Electricity Bill To State Assembly News By Uche Nwosu On Dec 17, 2024 0 25 Share Facebook Twitter Google+ WhatsApp In a bid to solve the perennial electricity interruptions in Abia State, the state government has sent a Bill, the Abia State Electricity Bill to the State House of Assembly for consideration.\nThis is aimed at having an independent electric power in the state that will curb perennial power outage in the state.\nThe Commissioner for Information, Prince Okey Kanu disclosed this while briefing journalists at the Government House, Umuahia on the outcome of this week’s State Executive Council of Abia State.\nAccording to the Commissioner, the State House of Assembly would on Wednesday, December 18, 2024 conduct a public hearing on the Executive Bill, even as he highlighted the importance of the Electricity Bill.\nKanu used the opportunity to stress the need for all stakeholders to participate in the public hearing.\nHis word, “All the critical stakeholders are expected to be there and make inputs on how to make the process of enacting that Bill, and come up with a robust idea that will address issues of electricity in our state”.\nHe explained that the “Light Up Abia Initiative” is still on, and that the focus which used to be on the major cities of Aba, Umuahia and Ohafia has now shifted to other areas like Bende, Ugwunagbo and Osisioma LGAs.\nThe Light Up Abia Initiative, he noted, has has reached 28 areas.\nThe Commissioner announced that governor Alex Otti has approved the reconstruction of the long abandoned iconic Omenuko bridge at Ozuabam in Arochukwu LGA, a bridge that links Abia North and Abia Central senatorial zones.\n“For decades, a lot of politicians have taken undue advantage of the rickety nature of that bridge to make promises to people around that area till date, they have never fulfilled.\n“His Excellency, Dr Alex Otti has ordered that, that bridge be reconstructed to serve the people from that area”, he added.\nOkey Kanu who said that the flag off of the project would be announced soon, stated that repairing the bridge would be of great benefit for the people.\nAdvertisement According to him, the ground breaking ceremony of the Abia airport project will take place Tuesday, 17, December 17, 2014 at Ubaha Nsulu in Isiala Ngwa North of the state.\nWhile highlighting the economic benefits of the project to Abia residents, including investments, tourism among others, the commissioner additionally opined that issues of protest and agitation by few members of the host communities have been taken care of.\nThe Commissioner appreciated the recent primary health care 400 Dollar UNICEF prize won by Abia State and said that the credit really goes to Governor Otti for his efforts in the health sector.\nHe revealed that the “Project Ekwueme” being the reconstruction of 200 primary health care centres across the Wards in Abia in 100 is ongoing, adding that the Ministry of Health would soon embark on free surgery for persons with hydrocil.\nThe Commissioner reiterated the commitment of the state government to providing security especially this yuletide and maintained that there is need for the people to always give useful information to the security agencies.\nOn the Civil Service of the state, the Abia Information Commissioner announced that the Abia State Head of Service, Dr. Mrs Ngozi Queen Obioma would be retiring from service this December, 2024, disclosing that Governor Alex Otti had at the Executive Council meeting congratulated her on quality service delivered to the state and wished her well.\nIn his comment on the merits of the Abia State Electricity Bill, the Commissioner for Power and Public Utilities, Mr. Ikechukwu Monday said that the law would act as a catalyst to achieve that goal of the governor which is to provide access to electricity to both the unserved and the underserved Abians and other residents of the state.\n“It’s a law that will be tailored to creating the Abia State electricity market. As we know, last year the Electricity Act 2023 was passed into law which gives states and sub nationals the framework and mandate to create their own electricity market.\n“We are looking at the full value chain, from generation to transmission to distribution. So, for Abia state, we are creating a market, an electricity market that will be competitive and efficient.\n“This will help to promote industrialization. As we know our people are gifted and without electricity there is no way we can achieve that that social economic growth of the state and that is why we took this time to draft this Bill”, Monday stated.\nMr. Monday further said that if passed into Law, three organizations would be created from the executive Bill.\n“Out of this Bill if passed into Law, some three organizations will be coming out of it, one will be Abia State Electricity Regulatory Authority, Rural Electrification Agency and the Abia State Electricity Fund”.\nHe explained that the regulatory authority would regulate all the sectors in the market, the rural electrification agency would take care of mostly the underserved while the electricity fund would be supporting to ensure that adequate infrastructure is provided and government can intervene in cases where people cannot afford to pay the tariff.\nAbia State 0 25 Share Uche Nwosu Prev Post\nNiMet DG/CEO Anosike Marks One Year In Office, Harps On Collective Bargaining With Unions\nNext Post\nAPRIPERF And Africa’s Desire To Protect Its Oil And Gas Assets",
