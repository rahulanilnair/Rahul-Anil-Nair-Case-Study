    "text": "Russia Tightens Grip on 'Foreign Agents'\nRussia's parliament passed a bill tightening control over those labeled as 'foreign agents'. This legislation mandates them to direct income from property sales and dividends into specific rouble accounts. The law targets entities backed by foreign support or influence, intensifying bureaucratic obligations.\n- Country:\n- Russia\nIn a significant legislative move, Russia's lower house of parliament has sanctioned a bill aimed at augmenting the government's regulatory mechanisms over individuals and organizations considered as 'foreign agents'.\nThis term, reminiscent of the Soviet era, applies to those receiving foreign support or alleged foreign influence, necessitating registration under stringent conditions.\nThe Duma's approval means such agents must now channel all income from property sales, vehicle rentals, and dividend interests into special rouble accounts, marking a substantial tightening of financial oversight.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nAdvertisement\nALSO READ\n[Revamping the Skies: A New Era in Indian Aviation Legislation](/article/business/3179966-revamping-the-skies-a-new-era-in-indian-aviation-legislation)[Health Headlines: From Abortion Legislation to Vaccine Preparedness](/article/health/3179992-health-headlines-from-abortion-legislation-to-vaccine-preparedness)[BJP Accuses Foreign Influence on Indian Politics](/article/politics/3182613-bjp-accuses-foreign-influence-on-indian-politics)[Lok Sabha Session Erupts in Heated Debate Over Foreign Influence Allegations](/article/headlines/3182498-lok-sabha-session-erupts-in-heated-debate-over-foreign-influence-allegations)[New Legislation Pushes for Family Unity in U.S. Immigration System](/article/law-order/3182169-new-legislation-pushes-for-family-unity-in-us-immigration-system)",
