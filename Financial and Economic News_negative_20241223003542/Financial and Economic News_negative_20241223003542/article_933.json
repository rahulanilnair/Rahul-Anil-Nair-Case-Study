    "text": "For maybe the first time ever, I agree with Roger Koopman. His Dec. 10 tariff criticism hits the bull's-eye describing proposed Trump tariffs as a bad idea. I practiced international trade law for 12 years in Washington, D.C., representing U.S. and international clients. I then taught it at the University of Montana and various overseas law and business schools for 25 more. I also advised multiple governments, including ours, on their trade agreement pros and cons. In this process I became something of a self-taught expert on international trade history, economics and politics. These experiences taught me two lessons. First, high tariffs caused the 1930s global depression which took World War II to end, and even helped trigger the War itself. When global trade came to a screeching halt after countries imposed retaliatory protectionist tariffs in response to high U.S. tariffs, Germany, Italy, and especially Japan decided to seize other countries’ national resources they could not acquire in the international marketplace; while Britain and France exercised their broad colonial powers to keep their colonies’ natural resources for themselves and starved the people in those colonies. People are also reading… Second, high tariffs guarantee high inflation by making all traded goods much more expensive, in turn creating serious product shortages which exacerbate inflation even more. Ironically, Donald Trump won the 2024 election campaigning against inflation, according to every poll taken since. Don’t take my word for it, read your political and economic history. When Koopman, most top experts and I agree on anything, we may all be right. David Aronofsky, Missoula",
