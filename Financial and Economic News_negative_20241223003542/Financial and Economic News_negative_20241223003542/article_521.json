    "text": "Philippine ‌Rice Prices Soar ​Amidst Allegations ⁣of price Manipulation The Philippines is ⁤grappling with ‌a surge in ‍rice prices,prompting a congressional investigation‌ that has implicated supermarkets and wholesalers in alleged price manipulation . The ⁤House’s “murang Pagkain Super-commitee,” led by Representative Joey Salceda, ‌is leading ‌the charge, ⁣issuing strong warnings and demanding ⁢accountability.\nSalceda, a ⁤prominent economist and lawmaker, delivered a stark message⁢ on December 17th: “I ​am warning‌ supermarkets and ⁣big groceries. We have received reports that imported well-milled​ rice is being⁢ labeled as premium rice and sold at P70 per kilo in supermarkets. That means they earn as much as P30​ pesos per kilo.”\nThe committee’s investigation has uncovered meaningful markups in the‍ supply chain. ⁣ “We disaggregated‌ market‍ returns and as much as 48‍ percent ⁤of excess returns are at the ⁤wholesale to retail level,” Salceda explained.He directly challenged justifications offered by‌ industry ⁣groups, stating, “I also ⁣do ⁤not ‍believe in the excuse given by both the Bureau of Plant Industry⁤ (BPI) and the Grains Retailers Confederation​ of the Philippines that the reason⁢ for stubborn⁣ price⁣ increases is ​consumer preferences for premium rice.”\nSalceda presented compelling ⁣evidence to ⁣counter⁢ these ‍claims. “We ⁣checked the latest ⁢reference⁣ values, and even the highest quality rice from Vietnam is just P41⁢ per kilo⁤ after duties. That doesn’t explain why prices are ​stubborn at P56,” he noted. ​ He further emphasized, “And that does‌ not match actual average import⁣ prices of P31 per kilo after duties — that is not ‌a premium price. ‌So, next time I get a reason like that, the⁤ committee will be forced to remind people that there are consequences to lying under​ oath.”\nGovernment’s Response ⁤Under Fire The committee also directed its criticism towards the⁢ Department of Agriculture (DA), questioning its​ effectiveness ‍in‌ controlling rice prices. ⁤Salceda rejected the DA’s frequent claim of powerlessness, stating, “Rice prices have become something⁣ of a death spiral. And with the DA‌ publicly saying they are powerless under the law,price manipulators ⁤are even more emboldened to‌ do as ⁣they please.”\nHe urged the​ DA to utilize ​existing legal tools to address‌ the‌ crisis. “We have ‌reviewed the ⁢statute books for what⁣ tools⁣ the DA can use to end ‍rice price abuse.We found several‍ laws that have not ‍been fully repealed,including RA 509,which ⁣would allow the DA a wide range⁣ of powers as ⁢soon as the President declares a ‘rice emergency’,” Salceda explained. he referenced President⁣ Quirino’s declaration of a rice ⁢emergency in 1948 to combat⁤ hoarding, adding, “I urge the ⁢DA to scour the ample body of laws enacted over ​the decades and mobilize these laws ‌to end​ the climate of economic impunity in the ⁢rice ‌market.” ⁣ He concluded by emphasizing the need for stronger ‍enforcement: “We must also use all the⁢ organs and powers of the state, from post-clearance⁤ inspections of ⁣import warehouses, to random⁢ inspections ⁣in markets, to remove the sense that there is no ‌sheriff in town.”\nThe investigation’s findings resonate with concerns ​about food security⁣ and affordability globally. The situation in the Philippines‍ highlights the challenges of regulating⁣ food prices and ensuring fair market practices,especially for essential ‍staples like rice. The committee’s actions underscore the need for openness and accountability in the food supply‌ chain.\nPhilippine Rice Prices Soar Amidst Allegations of Price Gouging\nRice prices in the Philippines are skyrocketing, leading to a congressional examination into alleged price ⁢manipulation by‌ supermarkets and wholesalers. Led by Representative Joey Salceda, the House’s “murang ‌Pagkain Super-committee” is demanding accountability and warning those involved that there will be consequences.\nA Conversation with Dr. Elena Reyes on the Rice Crisis\nWorld Today News Senior Editor, Maria Garcia, spoke with dr. Elena Reyes, an⁢ agricultural economist at the University of⁤ the⁣ Philippines,‍ about the escalating rice price crisis.\nPrices Soaring and Suspicions of Manipulation\nMaria Garcia: Dr. ⁢Reyes, the ‌price⁤ of rice has become a major concern for Filipino families. ‍We’re seeing reports ​of ⁤significant markups, especially when it‍ comes to imported rice. What’s your take on the situation?\nDr. Elena Reyes: it’s deeply troubling, Maria. the recent surge in rice prices is undeniably putting a strain on household ‍budgets, particularly for lower-income families who rely heavily on rice ‍as ⁢their staple food. While there are legitimate factors contributing to⁤ price⁢ increases, such as global ‍supply chain disruptions and rising input⁣ costs, the marked-up prices we’re seeing in retail markets raise serious concerns about‍ possible price gouging.\nMaria Garcia: Representative Salceda⁢ has been very vocal in his criticisms of supermarkets and wholesalers. He’s directly accused them of mislabeling imported rice to justify inflated prices. Do you think there’s​ merit to ⁣these claims?\nDr. Elena Reyes: The ‍evidence is certainly suggestive. Representative Salceda’s investigation has uncovered significant ‌discrepancies between import prices and retail prices,especially for certain varieties of rice. While there could be ⁤other factors at play, the substantial markups identified by the committee warrant a thorough investigation. Consumers deserve openness and fair pricing, especially for a crucial ⁤commodity like rice.\nThe Government’s Role and Calls for Action\nMaria Garcia: Representative Salceda has also criticized⁤ the Department of Agriculture (DA), stating they haven’t done enough to control rice prices. What’s your‌ perspective on the ‍government’s role in addressing⁤ this crisis?\nDr. Elena Reyes: The DA has a critical role to ​play in ⁤ensuring food security⁤ and affordability. They need to take a proactive stance, not just⁤ react to crises. ‍strengthening market monitoring and enforcement mechanisms is essential to prevent price manipulation and hoarding. ​The DA also needs to explore⁢ all‌ available legal​ tools​ to address the‌ issue,⁢ as Representative Salceda has suggested.\nMaria Garcia: What can be done to ⁣prevent this type of situation from ⁣happening again?\nDr. Elena Reyes: long-term solutions require a multi-pronged approach. We need to invest in sustainably increasing domestic​ rice production, diversifying our import sources, and strengthening social safety nets for vulnerable populations. The government also needs to work closely with the private sector‌ to promote transparency and fair pricing ⁤practices throughout the supply chain.⁢ Lastly, empowering consumers with information about rice prices and quality ⁢can help create a more equitable ⁤marketplace.",
