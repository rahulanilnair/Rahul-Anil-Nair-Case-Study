    "text": "Who is responsible for the high prices that are increasingly hitting Poles’ pockets? In the latest poll, more than half of respondents considered Prime Minister Donald Tusk to be to blame.\nPrices in stores are rising at an ever-increasing rate. In October, they were an average of 5.4 percent higher than a year earlier.\nThe high prices are hitting the pockets of Poles The latest data brings more alarming news. As reported on Tuesday by Business Insider, butter is the product seeing the fastest increase. It is currently 5 percent more expensive than it was just a week ago, with 200 grams already costing an average of PLN 8.95 (€2.10).\n“Butter is one of the fastest growing food products today (in terms of price),” said Dr. Mariusz Dziwulski, an expert in agri-food market analysis at PKO BP, in a recent interview on RMF 24.\nAccording to the analyst, next year we may end up paying as much as PLN 10 for a stick of butter.\nThe prices of broccoli and bananas have also increased.\n“On a weekly basis, the basket of basic products is more expensive by PLN 1.30. In percentage terms, this means an increase of 1.2 percent,” the website writes, citing an analysis of the PanParagon.pl application.\nWho is responsible for the increase in butter prices? Poles respond Who do Poles think is responsible for this state of affairs? The answer to this question is provided by the latest survey commissioned by “Super Express” by the Pollster Research Institute.\nRespondents were asked about a product that has become a symbol of skyrocketing prices in recent weeks: “Who is responsible for the recent increase in butter prices?” In response to this question, over half of respondents, 52 percent, indicated Donald Tusk.\nFar fewer respondents blame Adam Glapiński for the price of butter, with 20 percent of respondents indicating otherwise. Among those found responsible was also the chairman of Law and Justice (PiS), Jarosław Kaczyński, who was blamed by 14 percent of respondents. Notably, his PiS party is not currently in power.\nThe survey for “Super Express” was conducted by the Pollster Research Institute on Dec. 10-11 on a sample of 1,005 adult Poles.",
