On the sectoral front, buying was seen in the media sector of Nifty.\nIn the Sensex pack, Bharti Airtel, IndusInd Bank, JSW Steel, TCS, Asian Paints, L&T, Bajaj Finserv, Reliance, Nestle India, HDFC Bank, Maruti, M&M, Tata Steel, and Power Grid were the top losers. Only ITC was among the top gainers.\nThe rupee traded flat near 84.90 as markets remain focused on the Fedâ€™s final policy decision of the year scheduled for December 18.\n\"A dovish tone could push the dollar index lower, providing relief for the rupee. However, any uncertain or hawkish remarks may strengthen the dollar and keep participants bearish on the rupee. The rupee's range is anticipated between 84.75 and 85.05,\" said Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\n[Open in app](https://www.lokmattimes.com/install_app.htm?utm_source=www.lokmattimes.com&utm_medium=open_in_app&launch_url=https://www.lokmattimes.com/business/indian-share-market-ends-in-red-ahead-of-key-global-policy-decisions/)",
