    "text": "2 Min Read\nIt’s only Tuesday, and already it’s been a rough week in the courts for SpiceJet and its batting lessors. The day after the Delhi High Court issued summons to the CEO and COO, in a different case, the HC has now expressed “shock” at SpiceJet removing parts from planes that were returned to the lessor.\nThe HC was today, December 17, hearing a contempt plea filed by lessors TWC Aviation. The lessor had leased three engines and two airframes to the airline. After a payment dispute, the Delhi HC intervened, directing that the engines and airframes be returned.\nTWC Aviation now claims that while the engines and planes were returned, several parts were removed from the airframes.\nALSO READ:\nTWC Aviation argued that a total of 16 parts were removed from the first plane and 29 from the other by the airline. The lessor claims that SpiceJet is profiteering illegally by using the removed parts in other planes operated by the airline. The lessor stated that the returned engines and airframes have become useless, with SpiceJet removing parts.\nInterestingly, SpiceJet admitted before the Delhi HC to having removed parts from the airframes. SpiceJet argued that, as per the lease agreement, the lessor was free to sue for damages in separate proceedings.\nThe Delhi HC was taken aback by SpiceJet’s conduct after going through the lease agreement. The HC noted it was “shocking,” to say the least. The HC observed that no clause in the lease seemed to allow the removal of parts. The HC noted that its July 2024 order was clear that the entire plane had to be returned.\nThe Delhi HC even observed that it was considering, prima facie, holding the company in contempt. The HC also observed that it cannot allow such conduct by the airline.\nThe Delhi HC directed in its order that, prima facie, it found no merit in SpiceJet’s arguments. The HC further held that the clause cited by SpiceJet in the lease agreement did not permit the removal of engine parts.\nThe HC, however, stopped short of taking further action, such as summoning the top leadership of the company. The HC noted that it was deferring any further observations. The next hearing in this case will be on January 14.\nALSO READ:\nCompany | Value | Change | %Change |\n---|\nThe HC was today, December 17, hearing a contempt plea filed by lessors TWC Aviation.
