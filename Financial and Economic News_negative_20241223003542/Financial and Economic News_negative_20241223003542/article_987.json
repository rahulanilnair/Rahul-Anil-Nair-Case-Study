    "text": "By Renju Jaya ✉ | Published: 12/17/2024 12:38 AM ET | Australia's consumer confidence weakened at the end of the year with renewed concerns about the economic outlook, survey data from Westpac showed on Tuesday.\nThe Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer confidence index fell to 92.8 in December from 94.6 in November.\nAmong five sub-indices of consumer confidence, two indices track current conditions and three track expectations. All of the weakening in December was in forward looking components.\nThe 'economic outlook, next 12 months' sub-index dropped 9.6 percent to 91.2 and the 'economic outlook, next 5 years' sub-index declined 7.9 percent to 95.9.\nMeanwhile, the 'family finances vs. a year ago' sub-index rose a further 6.9 percent to 84.2. While pessimists still outnumber optimists, the gap is at its narrowest since the start of 2022.\nAt 103.2, the 'family finances, next 12 months' sub-index stayed above the 100-mark, indicating that optimists outnumber pessimists. However, this was down 0.9 percent from a month ago.\nThe 'time to buy a major household item' sub-index registered a significant improvement in December, rising 4.8 percent to 89.2, to hit a two-and-a-half year high.\nConcerns about economic outlook weighed on sentiment around jobs. The Westpac- Melbourne Institute Unemployment Expectations Index advanced 2.7 percent to 123.7 in December.\nThe 'time to buy a dwelling' index fell 6 percent to 81.6 in December. The survey showed that there is higher-than-normal degree of uncertainty about the outlook for housing.\nThe Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of House Price Expectations fell 5.3 percent to 142 in December, the lowest reading since April 2023.\nThe Reserve Bank Board next meets on February 17 and 18. Westpac economist Matthew Hassan said the board is likely to require further evidence of the desired slowing in inflation before it is prepared to relax policy.\nWestpac expects the Board to leave interest rates unchanged at its February meeting, with an easing expected to commence in May.\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com\nBusiness News\nSlide Shows Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In August 2024 Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In June 2024 Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In April 2024 Global Economics Weekly Update - December 09- 13, 2024 December 13, 2024 10:01 ET This week several major central banks announced their final interest rate decisions for this year.
