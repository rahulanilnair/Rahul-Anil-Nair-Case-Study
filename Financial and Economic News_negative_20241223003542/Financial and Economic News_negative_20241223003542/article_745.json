During the relevant period of 2017-18, the petitioner has filed the returns and paid appropriate taxes.

However, the petitioner had not responded to any of the above notices / intimation and the impugned order came to be passed. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that neither the show cause notices nor the impugned order of assessment has been served on the petitioner by tender or sending it by RPAD, instead it had been uploaded in the GST Portal, thereby, the petitioner was unaware of the initiated proceedings and was thus unable to participate in the adjudication proceedings. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that if the petitioner is provided with an opportunity, he would be able to explain the alleged discrepancies.\n4. The learned counsel for the petitioner would place reliance upon the recent judgment of this Court in the case of M/s. K.

It was further submitted that the petitioner is ready and willing to pay 25% of the disputed tax and that he may be granted one final opportunity before the adjudicating authority to put forth their objections to the proposal, to which the learned Additional Government Pleader appearing for the respondent does not have any serious objection.\n6. In view thereof, the impugned order dated 11.01.2024 is set aside and the petitioner shall deposit 25% of the disputed tax within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. The impugned order of assessment shall be treated as show cause notice and the petitioner shall submit its objections within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order along with supporting documents/material. If any such objections are filed, the same shall be considered by the respondent and orders shall be passed in accordance with law after affording a reasonable opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. If the above deposit is not paid or objections are not filed within the stipulated period, i.e., four weeks respectively from the date of receipt of a copy of this order, the impugned order of assessment shall stand restored.\n7. Accordingly, the Writ Petition stands disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.
