    "text": "- CyberKongz received a Wells Notice from the SEC, signaling potential enforcement action.\n- The SEC’s concern centers on the project’s combination of ERC-20 tokens with its blockchain game.\nCyberKongz, a prominent NFT project, has [announced](https://x.com/CyberKongz/status/1868746903053127941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1868746903053127941%7Ctwgr%5E089e4fa828382ce0d6db3daed19bc0b6eb7e3809%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcoinpedia.org%2Fnews%2Fsec-hits-gaming-firm-cyberkongz-with-wells-notice-clash-over-sale-of-genesis-kongz%2F) that it has received a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), signaling potential enforcement action. The project expressed disappointment in the SEC’s stance, arguing that the regulator’s misunderstanding of blockchain technology has led to unfair accusations.\nCyberKongz has received a Wells Notice from the SEC.\n— CyberKongz (@CyberKongz)\nWe are extremely disappointed at the approach the SEC has taken towards us, but we are going to stand up and fight for a brighter future that holds more clarity for NFT projects.\nWe have been suffering in silence for the last…[pic.twitter.com/lc6hyzUPb0][December 16, 2024]\nCyberKongz has pledged to challenge the SEC’s position, which could have broad implications for the Web3 gaming sector. The SEC’s concern centers on CyberKongz’s pairing of an ERC-20 token with its blockchain game. The regulator believes that this combination may constitute a security that requires registration, similar to the case against Ripple.\nHowever, Cyberkongz argues that the SEC’s [approach](https://www.sec.gov/) is misguided. The team believes the SEC’s lack of understanding could set a harmful precedent for the Web3 gaming industry. Furthermore, the project criticized the SEC’s misinterpretation of blockchain contracts. A key point of contention is the SEC’s treatment of the “sale” of Genesis Kongz in April 2021.\nIs the SEC Targeting CyberKongz Unfairly?\nCyberKongz maintains that this event was a contract migration, not a sale. The team pointed out that if the SEC cannot differentiate between a primary sale and a contract migration, it raises serious concerns about the clarity of digital asset regulations. They argue that this confusion jeopardizes the future of the industry and prevents proper legal clarity.\nFor over two years, CyberKongz has been in communication with the SEC. During this time, the project has experienced frustration due to the regulator’s lack of knowledge about blockchain technology. Despite these challenges, CyberKongz remains committed to advocating for clearer [regulations](https://thenewscrypto.com/stablecoins-at-risk-us-council-warns-to-implement-crypto-regulations/) for NFT projects.\nThey emphasized that they would continue fighting for the broader [Web3](https://thenewscrypto.com/dwf-labs-partners-with-blockchain-center-abu-dhabi-to-boost-web3-innovation-in-mena-region-2/) space, even if it means standing up to the SEC’s approach. However, they remain hopeful that future leadership will adopt a more balanced approach. CyberKongz showed solidarity with other industry leaders, such as Brian Armstrong of Coinbase and Devin Finzer of OpenSea, who have also faced regulatory pressure.\nHighlighted Crypto News Today[Can BGB Reach $5 Before a Possible Pullback?](https://thenewscrypto.com/can-bgb-reach-5-before-a-possible-pullback/)",
