It is about fostering innovation while ensuring accountability and transparency and, therefore, demands a shift to proactive risk management.\"\nSaran added, \"Trust must be cultivated by enhancing resilience against security vulnerabilities and privacy risks while adapting to evolving regulations. For Indian organisations, the imperative must be to integrate AI seamlessly into existing systems, addressing both technical and knowledge gaps to ensure sustainable adoption.\"\nThe report also notes positive strides in workforce readiness, with 60 per cent of employees in surveyed organizations possessing the necessary skills to use AI ethically and legally.\nFurthermore, 72 per cent of companies are addressing the skills gap by actively hiring individuals with the expertise required for the ethical use of AI. These initiatives highlight the growing emphasis on workforce preparedness as a key component of AI governance.\nDr Elea Wurth, Lead Partner of Trustworthy AI Strategy, Risk & Transactions at Deloitte Asia Pacific and Australia, emphasized, \"Effective AI governance is not just a compliance issue; it is crucial for realising the full potential of AI technologies. Our findings reveal that organisations with robust governance frameworks are better equipped to manage risks and experience greater trust in their AI outputs, increased operational efficiency and greater value and scale.\"\nIndian executives are generally optimistic about the transformative impact of AI governance, with 63 per cent believing that effective governance will foster higher trust in AI outputs, 60 per cent confident it will enhance their organization's reputation among customers, and 57 per cent expecting it to drive wider AI adoption due to increased confidence in the technology.
