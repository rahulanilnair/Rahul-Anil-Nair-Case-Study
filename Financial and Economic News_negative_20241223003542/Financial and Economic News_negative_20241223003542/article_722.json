    "text": "Oil prices fell on Tuesday amid renewed demand concerns following disappointing economic data from China, while investors remained cautious ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision.\nAt 0949 GMT, Brent crude futures were down 32 cents, trading at US$73.59 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 44 cents to US$70.27 a barrel.\nPrices were pressured by profit-taking after last week’s 6% rally and weak Chinese economic data, including an unexpected drop in consumer spending, IG market analyst Tony Sycamore noted. Despite some strength in industrial output, the data raised concerns about the strength of demand from the world’s largest oil importer.\nOn Monday, oil prices dropped from multi-week highs, driven by the disappointing Chinese data and a wait-and-see approach by investors ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy meeting.\nThe Fed is meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday for its final policy decision of the year, with a quarter-point interest rate cut widely expected. Investors will also be looking for signals on future rate cuts in 2025 and 2026 and any potential changes in strategy due to anticipated higher inflation under the incoming Trump administration.\n“A 25 basis point cut has already been priced in by the market, so any surprises from the Fed meeting could move the market,” said Anh Pham, an analyst at LSEG.\nInterest rate cuts typically boost economic growth and, in turn, oil demand, which is particularly important as oil market dynamics for next year could be influenced by rising supplies from non-OPEC+ countries, such as the U.S. and Brazil, combined with slowing demand, especially in China.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) reported last week that despite OPEC+ maintaining its output cuts, there will be a supply overhang of 950,000 barrels per day next year, nearly 1% of global supply.\nIn geopolitical developments, the European Commission announced a 15th package of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, including stricter measures against Chinese entities and additional vessels from Russia’s “shadow fleet,” which operates outside Western insurance and regulatory frameworks.\nWhile the new EU sanctions are unlikely to cause significant disruption, as most Russian oil flows now bypass Western services, they could still have some impact on global trade patterns, according to LSEG’s Pham.",
