With the recluse Joe Biden.\nTrump also deflected some questions he should never have answered, including his strategy for Ukraine and whether he would retaliate against Iran.\nPresident Trump leaves China, speculating next move after receiving invitation to inauguration ceremony\nHowever, this contradicted his recent statement that he would reach out to even hostile news organizations as long as they treated him fairly, which led to him launching an attack on the press. was a little surprised.\nThis means ABC and George Stephanopoulos have agreed to apologize to President Trump, donate $15 million to a presidential library or foundation, and donate another $1 million in legal fees to resolve the defamation case. It happened 2 days later. This avoided what could have been embarrassing and harsh deposits from star anchors.\nThe network's problem is that in E. Jean Carroll's civil suit, when a jury found Trump responsible for “sexual abuse,” Stephanopoulos said Trump was responsible for “rape.” He repeatedly said that he was recognized, and repeated those words about 10 times.\nThe judge said this would generally be understood as rape, but it is legally different in New York. I wouldn't agree to $15 million unless I thought there was a big lawsuit.\nThe New York Post Editorial Board wrote that President-elect Trump did not press ABC host George Stephanopoulos as hard as he could in a recent defamation lawsuit. (Getty Images)\nLeft-leaning pundits have accused ABC of “causing” to Trump, but the network has decided otherwise.\nTrump accused the media of being “highly corrupt” and further banned lawsuits he has filed or plans to file.\nThe president-elect has said he plans to sue the Des Moines Register over pre-election polls that turned out to be wrong.

Most journalists, including myself, said this act was a huge failure on the part of the CBS show.\n“We have to straighten out the press,” he said. “The press is highly corrupt. Almost as corrupt as our elections.”\nFurthermore, President Trump said, “I'm not doing it because I want to. I'm doing it because I feel obligated to do it.” “In my opinion, this was fraud and election interference.”\nPresident Trump also said he would file a lawsuit against Bob Woodward for releasing audiotapes from a book project. Woodward said he never agreed not to do so.\nFormer President Donald Trump and investigative journalist Bob Woodward are standing side by side. (Getty Images)\nAnd President Trump plans to sue the Pulitzer Prize committee for feeding Russia-Russia hoaxes to the Washington Post and New York Times. While this is certainly an exaggeration, the board said President Trump failed to point out any inaccuracies in the submitted articles.\nAnd Trump also commented on, well, other things.\nHe said he would consider pardoning indicted New York City Mayor Eric Adams, saying he had been treated “very unfairly.”\nHe said he doesn't understand how people can sympathize with the suspect in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. -That's what it is.'' Actually, I'm sick. ”\nJuror praised for acquitting Daniel Penny in strangulation trial: 'It was the right decision'\nHe praised Lara Trump but said it was up to DeSantis to decide whether to nominate her for the vacant Florida Senate seat.

(Adam Gray/Getty Images)\nHe defended Pentagon nominee Pete Hegseth, saying all he wants to do is improve the military. He also provided visual support, taking Hegseth to Army-Navy games with J.D. Vance, Elon Musk (of course), Ron DeSantis, Tulsi Gabbard, and Chairman Mike Johnson.\nPresident Trump said the polio vaccine would continue, but he would discuss other vaccines with RFK Jr., including the completely false theory that vaccines cause autism. President Trump has claimed that autism is on the rise among boys. “I don't think he's as radical as you think,” he told reporters.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nPresident Trump demanded an explanation from Biden officials, as they clearly know what is going on with the mysterious drone.\nThat's a lot of news. Perhaps we forget that Donald J. Trump loves to denounce everything under the sun. A 4-year renewal course will begin soon.\nHoward Kurtz is a host on the FOX News Channel. media buzz (Sunday 11am-12pm ET).
