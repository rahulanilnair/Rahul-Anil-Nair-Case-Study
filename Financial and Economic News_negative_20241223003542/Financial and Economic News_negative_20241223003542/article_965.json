    "text": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confronted an unprecedented challenge on Monday when Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, a key and loyal member of his Cabinet for years, stepped down. Her unexpected resignation prompted speculation about the future of the nearly decade-long leadership of Trudeau, whose approval has significantly dropped amid concerns over inflation and immigration, all while his government struggles to navigate the incoming presidency of Donald Trump.\n“The Great State of Canada is stunned as the Finance Minister resigns, or was fired, from her position by Governor Justin Trudeau,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Her behaviour was totally toxic, and not at all conducive to making deals which are good for the very unhappy citizens of Canada. She will not be missed!!!” Trump had previously mocked Trudeau by referring to Canada as a state. During his first term, when he renegotiated the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, Trump also criticized Freeland, claiming she was unpopular. Following a rushed meeting with Trump in Florida last month over threats to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods entering the U.S., the Republican leader humorously suggested Canada could become the 51st U.S. state.\nIn response to Freeland’s resignation, Trudeau quickly appointed his longtime friend and ally, Dominic LeBlanc, to take over as finance minister. LeBlanc, who serves as the public safety minister and had accompanied Trudeau to Mar-a-Lago for dinner with Trump, was sworn in to replace Freeland. Freeland did not attend that trip. After the swearing-in, LeBlanc shared with the press that he and Trudeau are prioritizing addressing the cost of living in Canada and aiming to find common ground with Trump on issues like border security and the economy. “It’s not been an easy day,” Trudeau later confessed to a gathering of party members, calling it one of his party’s “toughest days,” although he refrained from revealing his next steps.\nJagmeet Singh, leader of the opposition New Democratic Party (NDP), which has been crucial for Trudeau’s government to maintain power, called for the prime minister’s resignation earlier in the day. “He has to go,” NDP leader Singh said. While the Conservative Party, the primary opposition group, has not demanded Trudeau’s resignation, they have called for an election. However, a no-confidence vote is unlikely to take place soon, with Parliament preparing for a break over the holiday season.\nFreeland, who also served as deputy prime minister, revealed that Trudeau informed her on Friday that he no longer wanted her to continue in her role as finance minister and suggested she take up another Cabinet position. In her resignation letter, Freeland said the only “honest and viable path” was to leave the Cabinet. “For the past number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds about the best path forward for Canada,” Freeland wrote.\nFreeland and Trudeau had clashed over recent economic proposals, including a two-month sales tax holiday and issuing 250 Canadian dollar ($175) checks to citizens. Freeland opposed these measures, arguing that with Trump threatening a 25% tariff, Canada should avoid “costly political gimmicks” that could strain the country’s finances. “Our country is facing a grave challenge,” Freeland emphasized in her letter. “That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war.”\n{Matzav.com}",
