    "text": "Food inflation eased to a three-month low of 9 percent in November, with vegetable inflation cooling off to 29.3 percent from 42.2 percent a month before, but a Moneycontrol analysis shows that winter vegetables were still more expensive than before. Besides potatoes, which boiled on a nearly four-year-high inflation, carrots, radish, cauliflower and cabbage inflation too heated up in November. Out of the 19 categories tracked under the inflation basket, 10 recorded higher prices, and nearly all - 17 out of 19 - soared to double-digit inflationary state as of November 2024. // Garlic prices simmered the most, with an inflation of 85.1 percent compared with 82.8 percent in the previous month, followed by potato at 66.6 percent. Among the winter vegetables, cauliflower inflation at 47.7 percent was at a 33-month high, while cabbage inflation at 43.6 percent also hit a near three-year high in November. Tomato prices eased from 110 percent in October but were at a high 41 percent in November. Carrot prices rose the fastest in 32 months as inflation increased to 33.4 percent from 22.8 percent in the previous month. Palak and other leafy vegetables witnessed 24.6 percent inflation in November, highest in over a decade. The average mandi price for carrots was 18 percent higher in December compared with a similar period last year. Retail inflation declined to 5.5 percent in November, compared with 6.2 percent in the previous month. The high inflationary situation has deterred the Reserve Bank of India from moving towards a cut in key policy rates. In its December review, the RBIâ€™s Monetary Policy Committee held the policy rate unchanged for the eleventh time in a row at 6.5 percent. The central bank also raised its inflation forecast upward to 4.8 percent for FY25 from 4.5 percent projected earlier.\",",
