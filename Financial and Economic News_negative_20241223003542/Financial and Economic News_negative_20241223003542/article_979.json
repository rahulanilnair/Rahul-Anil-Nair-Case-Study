    "text": "SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec 17, 2024--\nGoodRx (Nasdaq: GDRX), the leading prescription savings platform in the U.S., today revealed startling healthcare disparities in its new report, “ Endocrinologist Deserts: A Critical Healthcare Gap for Millions in the U.S. ” With nearly 70% of U.S. counties lacking an endocrinologist, the report paints a stark picture of the barriers millions of Americans face in managing life-threatening conditions like diabetes.\nThe findings come at a critical time as the prevalence of diabetes continues to surge nationwide. Over 38 million Americans are living with diabetes, yet many cannot access the specialized care needed to manage their condition effectively. Endocrinologists play a critical role in diagnosing and managing complex hormonal and metabolic conditions, including diabetes, obesity, menopause, thyroid disorders, and more. But for 50 million Americans in endocrinology deserts, help is likely out of reach. The lack of access correlates with significantly higher rates of diabetes complications, obesity, stroke, and even death.\nKey findings from the report include:\nNearly 70% of U.S. counties are entirely without an endocrinologist , leaving millions to delay treatment, travel long distances, or go without care altogether. People in counties without endocrinologists face a 12% higher mortality rate from endocrine-related diseases , along with elevated rates of diabetes complications, obesity, and stroke. For patients, this could mean more hospital visits, increased medical expenses, and worse health outcomes. Diabetes death rates soar in endocrinology deserts, more than doubling in places like Buffalo County, South Dakota (143.3 per 100,000), compared to Bell County, Kentucky (56.6 per 100,000) where specialists are available. “The shortage of endocrinologists creates a critical barrier to care, leaving millions unable to manage life-altering conditions—a challenge compounded by rising medication costs and pharmacy closures,” said Tori Marsh, MPH, Director of Research at GoodRx. “Addressing these disparities requires innovative, equitable solutions like telemedicine and incentives for specialists to serve underserved areas, ensuring all patients have access to the treatment they need.”\nGoodRx is dedicated to supporting people with diabetes by making essential care more accessible through substantial savings on medications and devices like continuous glucose monitors, as well as expert-created health content to empower individuals to make informed health decisions for themselves and their families.
