    "text": "Invezz.com - The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has introduced a discussion paper aimed at addressing market abuse and improving transparency in the UK’s crypto markets.\nReleased on 16 December 2024, the proposals focus on strengthening admission and disclosure standards for crypto-assets.\nThese changes are part of a broader initiative to create a cleaner, more secure trading environment while protecting investors from the risks associated with cryptocurrencies.\nOver the past few years, the FCA has gradually tightened its regulatory stance on crypto-assets, highlighting the dangers posed by fraudulent activities and inadequate controls.\nDespite recent measures, the regulator warns that cryptocurrencies remain high-risk investments, where losses can be substantial, and investor protection is limited.\nFCA’s new proposals for admissions and disclosures The FCA’s discussion paper outlines a series of changes to enhance market integrity and investor confidence in crypto-assets.\nCentral to the proposals are stricter rules for admissions and disclosures.\nThese rules would ensure that authorized firms provide accurate and transparent information when admitting crypto-assets to trading platforms.\nThe regulator aims to reduce the potential for market manipulation by mandating more robust internal controls.\nInformation sharing between firms and authorities will also be a key focus to prevent abusive trading practices and fraudulent behaviors.\nThese measures are intended to promote fairness in the crypto markets and help consumers make better financial decisions.\nThe FCA has already implemented stringent standards for authorization, with only 10% of crypto firm applications approved in the first quarter of 2024.\nThe remaining 90% were rejected due to poor anti-money laundering (AML) standards.\nThis highlights the FCA’s commitment to ensuring only compliant and responsible firms operate in the UK’s crypto sector.\nOne of the core objectives of the FCA’s proposals is to modernize the market abuse regime for crypto-assets.\nBy aligning these rules with those applied to traditional financial markets, the FCA aims to address gaps that have allowed rogue operators to exploit the system.\nThe proposed innovations include enhanced monitoring mechanisms to detect suspicious activities and prevent market manipulation.\nThis initiative comes as the FCA steps up its oversight of crypto promotions. Earlier this year, the regulator issued more than 450 warnings against unauthorized promotions, underscoring the persistent risks facing investors.\nThese warnings serve as a reminder that many crypto-asset providers fail to meet regulatory standards, posing significant dangers to consumers.\nBalancing innovation and investor protection The FCA’s proposals reflect a careful balance between fostering innovation in the crypto sector and ensuring investor safety.\nBy tightening regulations, the authority hopes to create a secure environment where cryptocurrencies can evolve responsibly.\nThe measures aim to support growth while mitigating risks, particularly for retail investors who may lack the expertise to navigate the volatile crypto market.\nThe FCA’s call for feedback invites stakeholders, including industry participants and consumers, to contribute their views on the proposed changes.\nThis collaborative approach is expected to drive the development of a regulatory framework that enhances transparency, reduces market abuse, and aligns with global standards.\nThis article first appeared on Invezz.com",
