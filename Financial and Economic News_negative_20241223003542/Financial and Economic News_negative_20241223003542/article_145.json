    "text": "New Delhi, Dec 17 (IANS): Fitness startup Curefit's consolidated loss has increased by 42 per cent to Rs 888.5 crore in FY24 from Rs 625.5 crore in FY23.\nThe company's EBITDA loss surged by 123.4 per cent to Rs 587.97 crore in FY24 from Rs 263.2 crore in FY23.\nThe reason for the increase in the company's loss in the last financial year is the high cash burn. Curefit's advertising and promotion expenditure has increased by 40.67 per cent year-on-year (YoY) basis to Rs 188.5 crore in FY24 from Rs 134 crore in FY23.\nAt the same time, the company's expenditure on legal and professional services in the last financial year has increased by 56.62 per cent from Rs 79.3 crore in FY23 to Rs 124.2 crore in FY24.\nCurefit's expenditure on employees has come down by 5.62 per cent to Rs 324 crore in the last financial year.

These job cuts impacted workers across the company's brands like Sugar.fit, Carefit, Cultfit, among others.\nCurefit's operating income has increased by 33.6 per cent to Rs 926.6 crore in FY24 from Rs 693.7 crore in FY23.
