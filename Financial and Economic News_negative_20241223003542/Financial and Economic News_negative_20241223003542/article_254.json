    "text": "Fitch Ratings has downgraded OCI N.V.'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating to 'BB' from 'BBB-'.\nThe ratings remain on Rating Watch Negative (RWN). The Recovery Rating is 'RR4'. This follows recently closed transactions and the announced agreements to sell its methanol business.\nThe downgrade reflects that OCI's recently closed sale transactions of Fertiglobe plc and Iowa Fertilizer Company LLC (88% of group's 2022 EBITDA) and US clean ammonia project have greatly reduced its scale and the strength of its business profile. The RWN reflects our view that the company's business profile will further weaken once the announced sale of its methanol business is completed, despite the repayment of most of its debt.\nWe will resolve the RWN once the remaining sale transaction is completed, which may take more than six months. Upon closure of all disposals the company's business profile will be limited to its European nitrogen business with weak competitive position. While OCI has been repaying most of its debt with sale proceeds, its medium-term credit and business profiles are uncertain and will be shaped by the evolution of its future strategy and financial policy.\nKey Rating Drivers\nMost Businesses to Be Disposed: OCI has completed the sales of Iowa Fertilizer Company LLC (IFCO) to Koch Ag & Energy for USD3.6 billion and of its majority stake in Fertiglobe plc (BBB/Stable) to Abu Dhabi National Oil Company for USD3.62 billion and disposed of its US clean ammonia project to Woodside Energy for USD2.35 billion . The company has also agreed to sell its global methanol business to Methanex Corp. (BB+/Stable) for USD2.05 billion expected to be completed in 1H25.\nNet Cash Position: OCI has repaid most of its debt, with the primary remaining debt a USD600 million bond maturing in 2033. The company is in a net cash position and we expect OCI maintains this position until all remaining transactions are finalised. However, the financial policy and future business strategy following the completion of all disposals remain uncertain.\nUse of Net Proceeds Uncertain: Following the disposals, OCI repaid debt and announced extraordinary dividends of USD4.32 billion to shareholders. We understand part of the disposal proceeds after debt repayment, capex and transaction costs may be used for re-investment. However, the company's future use of net proceeds remains uncertain. While acquisitions to enhance the business profile could be potentially positive for its credit profile, provided they are credit accretive, further dividend payments cannot be ruled out.\nCapex Primarily for Clean Ammonia: OCI needs to complete the construction of the clean ammonia project before the asset handover and the settlement of the deferred consideration. As of end-September 2024 , the remaining expenditure was USD750 million , with the total investment estimated at USD1.55 billion . We expect the capex requirements can be comfortably covered by sale proceeds, along with cash flows from businesses in the process of disposal.\nMuch Smaller Scale: As of end-2024 OCI comprises methanol business, which sale is planned to be closed in 1H25, and European nitrogen business. EBITDA of these businesses in 2018-2023 fluctuated from a negative USD39 million in 2023 to USD750 million in 2021. Methanol prices increased considerably in December 2024 supporting the segment's profitability. However, nitrogen margins remain weak.\nEuropean Nitrogen Weak: OCI's business profile will be reduced to European nitrogen business following all the disposals. Its profitability is currently low due to persistently high natural gas prices. Title transfer facility natural gas prices are trading at about 40% over the year-to-date average due to geopolitical risks, a seasonal increase in prices and halted supply of Russian gas for Austrian domestic consumption. Although we anticipate European natural gas prices will average USD11 /mcf in 2025, European nitrogen operations are expected to remain less competitive compared to other regions.\nHowever, OCI's European nitrogen facility's gas usage efficiencies, flexibility to import ammonia through OCI's terminal in Rotterdam , and its diversified downstream portfolio may help weather the periods of high gas costs.\nDerivation Summary\nOCI's business profile is in transition, following the ongoing disposals of most of its assets.\nIn comparison to peers Methanex Corp. (BB+/Stable) and Consolidated Energy Limited (CEL, BB-/Stable), OCI's scale and market position have been notably reduced. Methanex has enhanced its scale and diversification through the acquisition of OCI's methanol assets, while CEL continues to leverage its North American natural gas advantage. OCI's European nitrogen operations face structural challenges due to high natural gas prices, contrasting with Methanex's and CEL's more favourable cost structures.\nCEL's recent acquisitions, including a majority stake in Oman Methanol Company , reflect its growth-oriented strategy amid a volatile commodity price environment. While Methanex and CEL have clear paths to deleverage and capitalise on their expansions, OCI's credit profile is contingent on the completion of its disposals and the strategic use of the net proceeds in the medium term, which remain uncertain.\nKey Assumptions\nThe assumptions are based on completed disposals. OCI's business is reduced to European nitrogen and methanol subsectors.\nEBITDA margin increasing to 20% by 2028.\nCapex of USD700 million in 2024.\nLarge special dividend of USD4.32 billion paid in 2024 and in 2025; no dividends thereafter.\nRATING SENSITIVITIES\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade\nCompletion of the disposal of the methanol business.\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade\nThe ratings are on RWN, so Fitch does not expect positive rating action. However, if OCI does not dispose of the methanol business and provides clarity on the group's use of net asset sales proceeds, future group strategy and financial policy, the RWN may be removed and ratings affirmed with a Stable Outlook.\nLiquidity and Debt Structure\nOCI maintains large cash balances. The main upcoming debt maturity consists of USD600 million bond due 2033. Proceeds of the asset sales will ensure strong liquidity for OCI, but this will ultimately depend on the company's strategy.\nREFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING\nThe principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.\nMACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS AND SECTOR FORECASTS\nClick here to access Fitch's latest quarterly Global Corporates Macro and Sector Forecasts data file which aggregates key data points used in our credit analysis. Fitch's macroeconomic forecasts, commodity price assumptions, default rate forecasts, sector key performance indicators and sector-level forecasts are among the data items included.\nESG Considerations\nThe highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. Fitch's ESG Relevance Scores are not inputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the relevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision.
