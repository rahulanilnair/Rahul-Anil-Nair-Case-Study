For context, always refer to the full article.\nOnline health personality Doc Willie Ong, a frequent target of deepfake advertisements this 2024, does not endorse an unregistered hair product Claim: In a GMA news report, cardiologist and online health personality Dr. Willie Ong, popularly known as Doc Willie, promotes a hair product that “naturally brings back black hair color.”\nRating: FALSE Why we fact-checked this: The Facebook post containing the claim has 1 million views, 3,400 comments, and 7,000 reactions as of writing.\nThe video appears to be a 24 Oras report by broadcast journalist Mel Tiangco, in which Ong seemingly endorses “South Moon Herbal Gray Hair,” a product that claims to restore one’s natural hair color without using hair dye. It claims to be a hair spray that must be used every night for seven days.\nThe facts: The video is fake and AI-manipulated. An analysis by the deepfake detection tool, TrueMedia.org , revealed that the video has “substantial evidence of manipulation” in the faces and voices.\nTrueMedia.org detected deepfake faces with 98% confidence, and detected manipulation of faces, “as in the case of face swaps and face reenactment,” with 97% certainty.\nThe tool’s analyses found the voice to be AI-generated with 100% confidence.\nThe analysis also stated that the structure and tone of the video “are typical marketing material which suggests it is scripted and not from real spoken audio.” This is unusual for a news report that is often informative and formal.\nNot FDA-registered: “South Moon Herbal Gray Hair” is not included in the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s list of cosmetic products with notification.\nTarget of fake advertisements: Ong has been a frequent target of deepfake advertisements promoting unregistered health products this 2024. Many of the false posts use edited videos taken from Ong’s social media accounts or manipulated videos of news reports.
