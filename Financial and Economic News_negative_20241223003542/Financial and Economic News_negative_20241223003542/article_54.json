The lavish spending he's proposed could boost US growth in the short term.\n\"But the impact of the higher tariffs he's mooted for US trading partners may also dampen the outlook for Europe. We need to wait to see the extent to which his election campaign promises become policy.\"\nWall Street ended mostly on the front foot, with a surge in tech giants helping the Nasdaq to a record high, but Asia was unable to pick up the baton.\nTokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore, Seoul, Taipei, Manila, Mumbai, Bangkok and Jakarta all fell, though Sydney and Wellington rose.\nLondon, Paris and Frankfurt dropped at the open.\nBitcoin hit another record high of $107,791 on continued optimism that Trump will introduce measures to deregulate the cryptocurrency market.\nThe Fed rate decision will be followed Thursday by announcements in Japan and Britain.\nOpinion is split on whether the Bank of Japan will unveil a third hike of the year -- having lifted in March for the first time in 17 years -- as officials in Tokyo look to shift the country away from years of ultra-loose policies.\nStill, while the BoJ and Fed are on course to bring their rates closer together, the yen is struggling to strengthen and is stuck around 154 per dollar.\n- Key figures around 0810 GMT - Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.2 percent at 39,364.68 (close)\nHong Kong - Hang Seng Index: DOWN 0.5 percent at 19,700.48 (close)\nShanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.7 percent at 3,361.49 (close)\nLondon - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.5 percent at 8,217,35\nEuro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0500 from $1.0509 Monday\nPound/dollar: UP at $1.2704 from $1.2678\nDollar/yen: DOWN at 153.95 yen from 154.13 yen\nEuro/pound: DOWN at 82.67 pence from 82.86 pence\nWest Texas Intermediate: UP 0.3 percent at $70.91 per barrel\nBrent North Sea Crude: UP 0.4 percent at $74.17 per barrel\nNew York - Dow: DOWN 0.3 percent at 43,717.48 (close)\ndan/mtp\nOriginally published on doc.afp.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .",
