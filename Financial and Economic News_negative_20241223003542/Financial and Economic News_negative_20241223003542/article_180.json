(PTI Photo)\nGlobal Billionaires in December 2024: In a world fueled by ambition and entrepreneurial spirit, visionary leaders have attained unprecedented wealth through innovation and strategic vision.\nIn FY 2023-24, the world has witnessed an unprecedented surge in wealth creation, with the net worth of the world‚Äôs wealthiest individuals sharply increasing.\nHowever, in a dramatic turn of events, the two globally renowned business personalities of India‚ÄîMukesh Ambani, the CMD of Reliance Industries , and Gautam Adani, chairman of the Adani Group‚Äîhave dropped out of Bloomberg‚Äôs $100 billion club for the year 2024.\nAdvertisement India‚Äôs wealthiest billionaires and Asia‚Äôs richest people are no longer part of the ‚Äòcenti-billionaire club,‚Äô Bloomberg reported, with Ambani‚Äôs net worth declining to $55.5 million while Adani‚Äôs lost a staggering $3.52 billion, according to the year-to-date return report.\nKnow | Top 10 richest ministers in Modi 3.0 Union Cabinet Looking at Mukesh Ambani‚Äôs case, the decline in wealth can largely be attributed to Reliance‚Äôs underperformance in its energy and retail operations.\nHis net worth declined from $120.8 billion in July 2024‚Äî during the extravagant celebrations of his youngest son Anant‚Äôs wedding ‚Äîto $96.3 billion presently, positioning him 17th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nMeanwhile, Adani‚Äôs net worth has fallen low due to the allegations and controversies going around him; while he has already been under scrutiny since January 2023, when the US short-selling firm Hindenburg Research issued a damning report.\nAdvertisement This year, the US prosecutors indicted Adani, his nephew Sagar Adani, and six others for allegedly offering Rs 2,029 crore (over $260 million) in bribes to Indian government officials to secure ‚Äúlucrative solar energy supply contracts‚Äù with state electricity distribution companies.\nRanked | Top 10 countries with the most billionaires in 2024‚ÄîIndia ranks third globally Even though he has rejected all claims, the conglomerate continues under examination, causing him to slide to 19th place on the Bloomberg Index as of December 17, 2024, with a current net worth of $80.8 billion.\nBloomberg Billionaire Index 2024: Top 10 richest people in the world As of December 17, 2024, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index has updated its rankings of the richest individuals. Please note that this ranking is dynamic and changes daily based on net worth analysis.\nRank Name Total Net Worth ($, Billion) Country 1 Elon Musk $474B United States 2 Jeff Bezos $251B United States 3 Mark Zuckerberg $221B United States 4 Larry Ellison $194B United States 5 Bernard Arnault $178B France 6 Larry Page $175B United States 7 Bill Gates $165B United States 8 Sergey Brin $164B United States 9 Steve Ballmer $156B United States 10 Warren Buffett $143B United States Source: Bloomberg Billionaire Index (As of December 17, 2024)\nAdvertisement Notably, the competition among the world‚Äôs billionaires remains dynamic, with Elon Musk currently in the lead due to his diverse investments and innovative business strategies. (Designed by Cherry Gupta) Musk last week made headlines once again by becoming the first person in history to have a net worth surpassing $400 billion , according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nDiscover | Top 10 countries adding millionaires at a rapid pace: India‚Äôs position explained His net worth increased by $58 billion on Wednesday after Forbes confirmed that SpaceX and its investors had agreed to buy back shares held by executives in a deal valued at $350 billion, as initially reported by Bloomberg.\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos and Meta‚Äôs Mark Zuckerberg are significant competitors, highlighting the ongoing volatility in global markets and individual business performances.\nNotably, Meta has become the world‚Äôs most widely used social media platform , boasting over 3 billion monthly active users. It ranks as the seventh-largest corporation globally, with a market capitalization of $1.255 trillion.\nAdvertisement Meta‚Äôs stock surged in early 2023, allowing Zuckerberg to reclaim his position among the world‚Äôs top 10 richest individuals for the first time since January 2022.\nIn case you missed it | Top 10 highest-paid government leaders globally in 2024 Why should you buy our Subscription?
