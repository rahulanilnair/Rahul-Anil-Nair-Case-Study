    "text": "EU Summit: A Quiet ‌Holiday Season Before the Storm? The European union’s pre-holiday summit⁤ typically brings ⁢a flurry of last-minute decisions. Last year, the EU approved Ukraine and Moldova’s accession talks, granted Georgia ‌candidate status, and imposed a significant sanctions package on Russia. However,⁣ this year’s pre-winter ‌break agenda appears‌ significantly less ⁢eventful, leaving many wondering what the quieter approach means for the future.\nA Less Dramatic⁤ Agenda Than Last ‌Year While a ‌new sanctions package ⁤against Moscow was approved on December 11th, it was notable more for its exemptions than its‍ sweeping impact. This contrasts sharply with the momentous decisions of 2022. ⁤As one‌ observer noted, “Just look at last year,” when the EU made significant strides on several fronts, ⁤including ⁤a ⁤major sanctions package against Russia.\nUkraine: ⁤Business as Usual? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will attend ⁣the December 19th ⁣summit, but no major decisions regarding Kyiv are anticipated. This contrasts with ⁢the celebratory atmosphere ⁤surrounding Georgia’s candidate status ​last ‌year. In fact, the EU’s response to⁣ Georgia’s increasingly hardline government will⁤ be a key focus⁤ this week.\nThe draft ⁣EU summit conclusions “reconfirm the ⁣European union’s unwavering commitment to providing continued political, financial, economic, humanitarian,⁢ military, and diplomatic support to Ukraine and its people for as ⁣long as it takes and as intensely as needed.Russia must⁣ not prevail.” This​ reflects⁤ the EU’s⁢ consistent stance throughout the‌ year. While discussions ⁢about negotiations⁢ with Moscow are ongoing, the EU appears committed to its current approach to⁢ Kyiv.\nHungary’s previous resistance ⁣to financially supporting Ukraine has been resolved, with Budapest agreeing in November to ⁢a G7-EU initiative leveraging frozen Russian assets for ⁤a €45 billion loan to Kyiv, supplemented by an additional €12.5 billion from the ⁣EU ‍budget.\nDuring the summit, Zelenskiy is expected to urge EU‌ member states to increase defense production,‌ ideally in‍ collaboration with ​Ukraine’s ⁢defense industry,⁤ and to provide Kyiv ⁤with advanced air defense and drone interception systems.\nSanctions: A Look Ahead The draft summit ⁤conclusions‍ state that “the European Union remains ready to⁢ step up pressure⁢ on Russia, including by adopting further sanctions.” The⁤ European Commission is ⁤highly likely to propose a ‍new sanctions package (the 16th ‌as‌ the full-scale invasion)‌ early ⁣next year. Poland,​ assuming the EU Council presidency on January⁤ 1st, has indicated‍ its⁢ intention to prioritize stricter measures ‌against Moscow.\nThough, the recently approved 15th package ⁣offers little cause for optimism, as⁤ it focused on exemptions rather than targeting new sectors of the ‌Russian economy. This suggests that‌ future ⁤sanctions may face similar challenges.\nEU​ Expansion: ⁤A Balancing Act of Geopolitics and Aspirations The European Union’s ongoing ‍expansion continues to be a ⁤complex geopolitical chessboard, with⁢ several nations‍ vying for membership while facing significant hurdles.‌ Recent⁤ developments highlight the intricate interplay of political will, economic conditions, ‍and international relations shaping the future of the EU.\nAlbania and Montenegro: Progress ​Towards Membership Albania and Montenegro are making strides in their EU accession ⁣journeys. Albania recently opened two new EU ⁣accession chapters related to foreign policy, ‌building on ⁤five chapters opened‌ in October.this demonstrates⁢ significant momentum in its bid for⁤ membership.‌ Simultaneously occurring, Montenegro, having ‌already opened negotiations⁤ on all 33 policy chapters,⁢ achieved a notable milestone by closing ‍three‌ chapters—details⁢ society, industrial ⁢policy, and intellectual⁣ property—for the first​ time ‌as 2017. This signifies the successful integration of EU laws into Montenegrin law, a ‍crucial step forward.EU diplomats have‍ even hinted at the possibility ⁣of Montenegro joining the bloc within ‌this decade.\nSerbia Faces Roadblocks Serbia’s path to EU membership, however, is significantly more challenging. ⁢While⁣ the European Commission and several EU ‍member states,including ‍France and⁤ Italy,believe Belgrade is ready to proceed with⁤ integration,⁢ the ‌Baltic states (Estonia,Latvia,and Lithuania) ‌have blocked further progress due to serbia’s continued refusal to align with​ EU sanctions against Russia. The Netherlands also withheld approval,​ citing​ unmet benchmarks ‌on certain chapters. ⁢ The situation underscores the complex relationship between EU expansion and geopolitical tensions.\nThe issue of Serbia’s progress is expected⁤ to resurface in early 2025, perhaps intertwined with the EU accession processes of Ukraine and Moldova. While ‍kyiv and Chisinau are anticipated to officially begin their accession journeys under⁢ the Polish presidency, Hungary’s potential opposition due to concerns ‍about its ethnic Hungarian minority in Ukraine adds another layer of complexity.A potential “grand bargain” in 2025, granting both Serbia ⁣and Ukraine the green light, remains⁣ a possibility.\nGeorgia’s Uncertain Future Georgia’s EU‍ aspirations face significant uncertainty. The European Council expressed “serious concerns regarding the course of action taken by ‌the ⁤Georgian government, which runs counter⁤ to the values and principles upon which the European ⁤Union is founded.” The⁢ EU also “regrets”‌ the Georgian government’s decision to suspend the country’s EU accession process until 2028, ⁢highlighting the challenges posed ⁢by internal political dynamics.\nThe EU’s expansion policy remains a dynamic process,influenced by both internal political‍ considerations within the EU and the⁣ geopolitical⁢ landscape of‍ Europe and beyond. The paths of Albania,​ Montenegro, Serbia, and Georgia illustrate the diverse challenges and opportunities ⁣inherent in⁣ the ongoing‍ expansion of‌ the⁢ European Union.\nEU Weighs Response to Georgia’s Crackdown on Pro-EU Protests The European Union is facing a​ delicate balancing⁤ act: how to‍ respond to ‍Georgia’s forceful suppression of recent pro-european Union⁣ protests. ⁤ While the EU has condemned the violence, a ‌strong,​ unified response remains elusive due to differing opinions among member states.\nThe EU’s⁣ official statement, ⁤while condemning the violence, carefully ‍avoids overly‌ harsh criticism. ​”The Georgian authorities must respect the right of‍ freedom of assembly and of expression and refrain from⁣ using force,” the ​statement reads. “All acts of violence must be investigated and those responsible held accountable.”\nThis measured response reflects the reluctance of countries like⁤ Hungary and Slovakia to take a strong stance against the Georgian government, which they view as an ⁢ally.‍ This support for the ruling⁤ Georgian Dream party, ‌led by the influential billionaire ‍Bidzina Ivanishvili, significantly impacts the likelihood of broader EU‌ sanctions.\nWhile ⁣estonia and Lithuania have already taken independent measures, as reported earlier in December , ⁣further ​individual actions by EU member states⁤ are possible, but widespread sanctions ‍remain unlikely.\nOne potential,‍ albeit symbolic, measure under consideration⁢ is⁤ the suspension of visa liberalization for Georgian ⁢diplomats. This option requires only a qualified majority vote within the EU,making it a more feasible path than a broader suspension impacting‌ all‍ Georgian ‍citizens.\nThe idea⁢ of targeting diplomatic‌ passports was extensively discussed during a meeting of EU foreign ministers on October 16th. ‍ While no decision was reached than, the European Commission‌ has been tasked with further investigation and is expected to ⁤present⁤ a proposal soon.\nThe⁤ Commission’s recent annual report on the visa suspension mechanism, published December 6th, ⁤provides further⁣ context. ‌Georgia received the most critical assessment,citing concerns about its “foreign agent” law and⁣ anti-LGBTQ+ ⁢measures as infringements on essential⁢ human rights.\nThe report highlights Georgia’s lack of progress on aligning its‌ visa policies with the EU, including a recent visa-waiver agreement with China. furthermore,⁢ the report criticizes Georgia’s absence of a national anti-corruption strategy and its failure to establish an⁢ asset recovery ⁢office.\nLooking Ahead: EU Court Ruling and Future Sanctions An upcoming EU court‌ ruling on‌ December 18th concerning sanctions against Moldovan oligarchs ⁣Ilan​ Shor and Marina ​Tauber holds significant implications. A favorable ruling for​ Shor and Tauber⁣ could complicate​ future sanctions renewals, particularly given a previous October ruling against similar sanctions targeting another moldovan oligarch, Vlad Plahotniuc.\nThe outcome of ⁢this case ‍will be closely watched, as it could​ set​ a precedent for future sanctions ‌decisions and potentially⁣ influence the EU’s ‍approach ​to Georgia and other countries facing ‍similar challenges.\nThis year’s ⁢developments underscore the complexities of EU foreign policy,balancing the need​ to uphold democratic⁢ values⁢ with the realities of geopolitical alliances and internal divisions⁣ among member states.\nExpert Forecasts Shifting Global Power Dynamics Rikard Jozwiak, a renowned political analyst, recently offered ⁢a compelling ⁢assessment ‌of the evolving global political landscape,‍ providing insightful predictions for the ‌year ahead. His ⁢analysis, delivered in a recent briefing, touched‌ upon several ‌key areas of concern and offered a glimpse into potential future scenarios.\nJozwiak’s briefing‌ highlighted the increasing complexities of ⁣international⁢ relations, emphasizing the‍ need for careful observation and⁢ strategic understanding. He underscored the interconnectedness ‍of global events, noting that developments ⁢in one ⁣region⁤ can quickly ripple across the globe, impacting even seemingly distant‌ nations. This interconnectedness, he argued, necessitates a nuanced approach to foreign policy and international cooperation.\nWhile⁢ specific details of his predictions were not publicly‌ released, Jozwiak’s briefing emphasized the importance of proactive ‍diplomacy and strategic partnerships in navigating the challenges ahead. ‌He stressed the need for‌ a collaborative approach to address global issues, suggesting that international cooperation is crucial for mitigating potential conflicts⁢ and fostering stability.\nThe analyst’s insights are particularly relevant to the United States,given America’s ‌significant ‍role‍ in global affairs.
