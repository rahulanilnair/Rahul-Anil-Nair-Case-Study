The measure called for taxes levied at a combined tax rate of 10.4455 mills, up from 8.3155. The rate is comprised of the general fund tax rate of 8.1204 mills, the fire fund tax of 1.8461 mills, a special roads fund tax of .32 mills and a streetlight fund tax at a rate of .159 mills.\nCouncilmember Brent Labenberg said the budget process has been \"very depressing\" this year.\n\"Don't think we don't care about you guys,\" he said. \"It's really hard.\"\n\"When we look at the numbers, there's nothing left to cut,\" Labenberg said.\n\"Everyone up here has done what they think is right, as painful as it is,\" said Councilmember Chris Hoenscheid.\n\"[There was] no party politics,\" he said. \"We are all looking out for you and our borough. Every person has your and has always had your best interests at heart.\"\nThe borough felt the pinch in several areas, officials said. For example, pension costs increased by $54,000; health care costs increased by 11%, or $124,995. Workers' compensation increased by $54,780, or 34%. Electricity costs increased by 30%, or more than $40,000. Similarly, natural gas increased by more than $13,000, and refuse costs increased by $518,628.\nOfficials also expect a revenue drop of more than $1 million partially because construction is down. Thus, permitting revenues are expected to decrease by more than $30,000.\nOther capital costs were covered on Monday.\nThe first on the list was $150,000 for roof repairs for the Emmaus Public Library whose \"roof is completely rotted and badly leaking into the building,\" officials said.\nOther large expenses included $104,500 for a police car and $66,646 for pool repairs.\nAs it stands, the crack causes the pool to lose 55,000 gallons per day, officials said.\nAnother area of high costs relates to sewer upgrades from Lehigh County Authority, starting in 2026.\nLCA is a nonprofit municipal authority whose mission \"is to protect public health and the environment by providing high-quality, safe, and reliable water and wastewater services,\" according to its website .\nThe upgrades are projected to cost the borough $18.7 million. The budget also includes $4 million the borough must spend on sewer line upgrades, officials said.\nRemediation of city wells 1 and 2 is another large project, with a cost of $13 million for which the borough anticipates a 50% grant.\nAccording to a February 2024 notice from borough manager Shane Pepe, the aquifer that feeds the wells is directly adjacent to the borough's fire training facility. Over the years, activities included firefighting foam which was often used in training and practice.\nUnbeknownst to those involved, the foam contained harmful PFAS or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. PFAS is \"a large, complex group of synthetic chemicals that have been used in consumer products around the world since about the 1950s,\" according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Services .\nAccording to Pepe, a large number of budget cuts are also included in the 2025 plan. Those cuts include the following: eliminating three current full-time employees, including the assistant borough manager, parks director, and full-time ambulance positions; elimination of three other full-time positions, including a police officer, the replacement of a retiring public works employee and a management position in the fire/ambulance department.\nFurther cuts include eliminating a second ambulance during the day, Monday through Friday.\nThe original proposed tax increase was just over 50%, according to Pepe, which would have helped maintain the positions as well as other capital items that were cut from the budget.\nThe borough's current millage rate is 8.3155, which includes a general tax fund tax of 6.4404 mills, a fire fund tax of 1.3961 mills, a special roads fund tax of 0.32 mills and a street light fund tax of 0.159 mills.\nThe proposed rate for 2025 would represent an increase of 25.6%. For a property assessed at $100,000, the proposed tax bill for 2025 would equal $1,044.55, compared to $831.55 this year.\nLocal developer Jonathan Wilhite supported the measure.\n\"[An] increase is not new to us; it's a way of life,\" Wilhite said. \"I support the difficult decision made to raise the tax rate. It's not an easy thing to do. I'm proud of them for attempting to run a balanced budget.\"\nA driver of costs, officials said, was maintaining the borough's services.\nEmmaus residents have the benefit of a paid fire department — one of the only in the area. Additionally, they have a police department and ambulance service, among other services.\n\"[The councilmembers] do a great job, [but] we have to honestly ask if we can afford this model. Are we holding on because it's the best choice, or because it’s always been?” asked former Councilmember Chris DeFrain.\nDeFrain offered advice to the current council, and said the borough would benefit from conversations for the short- and long-term health of the borough.\nMichael Felegy, a resident who is also a member of the East Penn School District board of directors, called the increases \"outrageous.\"\n\"If cuts need to be made, they need to be made,\" he said.\nResident Kelly Charters was against the increase.\n\"The increases are not realistic in this economy,\" Charters said.\nResident Lisa O'Boyle agreed.\n\"This is not the time for a 26% increase,\" she said.\n\"At this point in our lives, we have had increases across the board — from food to electric to insurance to gas to clothing to all of our needs,\" she said. \"Where do you draw the line? People are having trouble putting food on their tables.\"\nOverall, the borough council thanked residents for making their opinions known and encouraged more participation in the future. For their part, residents encouraged better communication between themselves and councilmembers.\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",
