    "text": "Sabres’ $7.6 billion net worth owner Terry Pegula backs team following tenth CONSECUTIVE loss\nSabres owner Terry Pegula has backed the team and expressed confidence in them despite losing 10 games in a row.\nTerry Pegula (Image via WKBW)\nIt seems to be one setback after another for the Buffalo Sabres. On Sunday against the Toronto Maple Leafs, the team lost their tenth successive game following a 5-3 defeat. Despite this poor run of form, $7.6 billion worth team owner Terry Pegula has backed them.\nThe Sabres did not enjoy a good start to the 2023-24 season. They won just one of their opening six games. However, after that, they had a bit of change in their fortune and with some wins, raced to a 11-9-1 record at one point.\nTheir losing streak started on November 27 when they dropped the game against the Minnesota Wild by a score of 1-0. Since then they have lost several games by a close margin. In the game against the Leafs, the team was 2-0 at one stage but ended up losing 5-3.\nEarlier on Monday emerged that Pegula was traveling to Montreal, with the team currently scheduled to take on the Montreal Canadiens on Tuesday. He would deliver a message to the players, coaches and team management.\nAs per Daily Faceoff’s Frank Seravalli, Pegula expressed confidence in coach Lindy Ruff and GM Kevyn Adams. Pegula, who also owns the NFL’s Buffalo Bills, said that he believed in his team and there are themselves the solution to the problem.\nSources indicate\n— Frank Seravalli (@frank_seravalli)[#Sabres]players met with owner Terry Pegula and GM Kevyn Adams today in Montreal.\nSummary of message: “We believe in you. The solution is within this room.”\nPegula professed faith in Adams, Ruff, and apparently told players to not expect a big trade.[December 16, 2024]\nFollowing the tenth successive loss, coach Ruff admitted that this poor run of form was on him. He claimed that he was “lost for words” after the defeat and that it was on him to fix the mess.\nSabres make shocking roster move after meeting with owner Terry Pegula\nThe Buffalo Sabres are not in a good position at the moment. The team’s tenth loss in a row has plummeted them down to 7th in the Atlantic Division standings. Following an emergency meeting with team owner Terry Pegula, the franchise made a shocking roster move.\nThe team has loaned goaltender Devon Levi back to the AHL. He was brought up to face the Leafs and after this heavy defeat, they have sent him down again.\nThough the keeper has struggled to find his feet in the big leagues, this is a shocking trade, considering it came after Pegula told the players no big trade was happening. After making 36 saves in the loss against the Maple Leafs, Levi has been demoted to the minor leagues.\nWe have loaned Devon Levi to\n— Buffalo Sabres (@BuffaloSabres)[@AmerksHockey].\n→[pic.twitter.com/t44SYq7XWy][December 16, 2024]\nIn the AHL, the 22-year-old goalie has a 6-0-0 with a .938 save percentage and has two shutouts in his last six games with the Rochester Americans. Given his impressive performances, chances are that he could be recalled back sooner.\nAs for the whole Sabres team, they will put an end to this barren run on Tuesday. With a current record of 11-16-4, chances are that the team will miss the Stanley Cup playoffs once again this season.",
