    "text": "| ELM CITY — After reviewing the budget, town finance officer Tiondra Fields concluded Elm City can’t afford to hire a third-party utility management company as commissioners voted to do last month. Discussion on the issue was brief during town commissioners’ Dec. 10 meeting. “The town cannot afford this company currently, per our town finance officer,” Mayor Tawanda Moore said in her report as town administrator. Commissioner Gil Wheeler said he wasn’t aware of the cancellation. “When did we find out we could not afford this?” Wheeler asked. “I was thinking we should maybe already know that. In the future, can you tell us (commissioners) that, so we’re not finding out at a meeting like everybody else does?” Moore only responded by saying, “We’re not going to spend what we don’t have.” At the town’s August meeting, Dana Hill, state director for the utility company Clear Water Solutions, proposed a $40,000 per month contract that would include three full-time public works employees, one full-time water and sewer employee, one part-time water and sewer employee and one project manager to oversee water, wastewater and public works management along with two service trucks. He said the team would identify operational deficiencies, clean storm drains, repair most leaks, assist in grant writing and prepare short-term and long-term system goals. During the town’s November meeting, Moore said she gave Hill the town’s budget and said if the town can’t afford Clear Water’s services, there’s no need to move forward. Commissioners agreed during that meeting to sign a one-year deal pending approval from the Local Government Commission.",
