The US central bank is widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of the meeting on Wednesday, bringing rates down by a total 100 bps in 2024. But the central bank’s outlook on rates will be closely watched, especially in light of recent data showing inflation grew stickier in November, while the labor market remained strong. CME fed-watchtool shows more than 95% chance for a 25bps cut by Fed in this week’s meeting. On the geo-political front, Israel agreed on Sunday to double its population in the Golan Heights, citing Syrian threats despite the moderate tone of rebel leaders who ousted President Bashar al-Assad a week ago. On data front, retail sales from China was reported lower than estimates.

December 17, 2024 09:16 Stock market live updates today: I Akshay Chinchalkar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, on the daily Nifty trends and the market’s short-term outlook. The Nifty retraced a portion of the Friday short squeeze, creating a “bearish harami” formation. That means the next tactical move will be decided by which of yesterday’s high or low gets broken first. For the day, resistance rests between 24726 and 24800, while supports lie in the 24554 - 24580 range. What’s also interesting is that the Friday low took support at the Bollinger-middle line, which means buyers remain active on any decline inside what will soon be a period of reduced volumes and therefore higher volatility.\nDecember 17, 2024 09:15 Stock market live updates today: SPARC ANNOUNCES INKING OF BINDING LOI WITH UCSF AND TILLER THERAPEUTICS FOR PRE-CLINICAL ONCOLOGY ASSET AND ASSOCIATED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY December 17, 2024 09:14 Stock market live updates today: Anand Rathi Group’s brokerage arm Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers files DRHP with SEBI for Rs 745 crore IPO Anand Rathi Group’s brokerage arm Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers files DRHP with SEBI for Rs 745 crore IPO.
