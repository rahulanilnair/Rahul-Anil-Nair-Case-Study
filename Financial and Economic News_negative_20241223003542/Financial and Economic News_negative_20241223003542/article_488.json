    "text": "Enbridge Line 6 oil spill raises alarm over Line 5 reroute risks, environmentalists warn Caitlin Looby and Laura Schulte, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Tue, December 17, 2024 at 11:07 AM UTC 5 min read\nNews that a Canadian-owned pipeline had what is considered the largest oil spill in Wisconsin history last month has raised concerns about another of the company's lines, which runs through the northern part of the state as well as the Great Lakes basin.\nOn Nov. 14, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources announced it had approved the reroute of the controversial Line 5 pipeline in northern Wisconsin – a project that environmental groups and Great Lakes tribes say continues to put the world’s largest surface freshwater system at risk.\nThen, last week, it was publicly learned that Enbridge Energy’s Line 6 – a 465-mile pipeline carrying crude oil from Superior, Wisconsin, to a terminal near Griffith, Indiana – spilled an estimated 1,650 barrels, or 69,300 gallons, in the town of Oakland in Jefferson County, according to federal officials.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement However, the Line 6 spill actually was first detected Nov. 11. That meant the DNR released the permit approval of the Line 5 reroute three days after it learned of the spill.\n“You would hope that the state would make Enbridge clean up its mess before even considering the reroute of Line 5,” said Tony Gibart, executive director of Midwest Environmental Advocates. “That did not happen.”\nEnbridge has proposed to reroute the Line 5 pipeline around the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa’s land. In June 2023, a federal judge ordered that the oil giant was in trespass of the Band’s land, as the right-of-way easement expired more than a decade ago after the Band chose not to renew it, fearing environmental harm. The pipeline must be removed or rerouted from the Band’s land by June 2026 as designated by court order.\nStill, the 41-mile reroute project has been hotly contested , as the Band and environmental groups argue that the new stretch of pipeline will still sit within its watershed, risking Lake Superior and important resources like the Kakagon Sloughs , a wetland complex on the Band’s land that is internationally recognized for its ecological and cultural importance.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement According to Gibart, the Line 6 spill is an example of what can go wrong and why the project should not have been permitted.\nDNR officials have said the Line 5 reroute could be safely done, and that impacts would be limited. Industry groups said the proposed reroute will be a win for Wisconsin’s economy and workers.\nEnbridge spokesperson Juli Kellner did not immediately respond to questions regarding Line 5 opponents' concerns over the Line 6 spill. However, Kellner said cleanup efforts are ongoing and the Canadian company is working with the DNR.\nMore: Enbridge pipeline spills nearly 70,000 gallons of crude oil in Jefferson County\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in U.S. White House Adviser Says Government Has Solved Drone Mystery The Daily Beast Officials stunned after iconic lake sees huge increase in water level — here's what happened The Cool Down Jamie Foxx recovering after physical altercation at Beverly Hills restaurant CNN California DMV apologizes for license plate, car owner's son says it's 'misunderstanding' USA TODAY Bad River Band Chairman Robert Blanchard told the Journal Sentinel he was concerned that “over a month went by before we were notified of the spill.”\nBlanchard explained the terrain near Lake Superior and the Band’s land is rugged and steep. If a spill or accident were to happen, Blanchard said the fastest response time would be two hours, and likely longer if the company has to mobilize large equipment.\n“And by that time, who knows,” Blanchard said.\nThe Band has since contested the wetland and waterway permit granted by the DNR and filed a lawsuit against the state agency, arguing the final environmental impact statement violates the state’s Environmental Protection Act.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement According to Stefanie Tsosie, senior attorney with the Tribal Partnerships Program at EarthJustice, the permit has a lot of conditions, but Enbridge has a history of not following those conditions as well as a history of accidents and spills.\nThe reroute is a “false solution,” Tsosie said.\nIn its roughly 70-year tenure, Line 5 has leaked 35 times and released a total of more than 1.13 million gallons of oil into the environment, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration database.\nNovember's Line 6 spill is another reminder of the risks.\n“This is news, but it’s not news,” Tsosie said. “It’s not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.”\nCleanup around Line 6 spill is underway The Line 6 spill was found during a routine inspection by an Enbridge technician. The spill occurred due to a faulty connection on a transfer pipe within the Cambridge Station, which was shut down and isolated. Following excavation of the area, the source of the spill was repaired and the station was returned to service.\nAdvertisement Advertisement The release involved a faulty connection on a pump transfer pipe within the Enbridge Cambridge Station which has been repaired.\nKellner said in an email Monday that soil removal is ongoing and it estimates about 60% of the volume − or roughly 30,000 gallons − were removed from the soil thus far.\n\"We are working with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources as cleanup and restoration proceed,\" Kellner said, in an email.\nThis isn't the first time an Enbridge pipeline has spilled in Wisconsin. Enbridge failed to report a spill in early 2019 for more than a year even though the company was well aware that a large amount of an oil substance had been released near Fort Atkinson, also in Jefferson County.\nAdvertisement Advertisement And in 2010, another pipeline leak resulted in 50,000 gallons of oil entering the environment in Adams County.\nMore: Along Wisconsin's northern shores, Line 5 continues to pit tribal culture against Big Oil\nMore: As Lake Superior wetlands become more vulnerable, tribe fears cultural guideposts could slip away\nCaitlin Looby can be reached at clooby@gannett.com or follow her on X @caitlooby.
