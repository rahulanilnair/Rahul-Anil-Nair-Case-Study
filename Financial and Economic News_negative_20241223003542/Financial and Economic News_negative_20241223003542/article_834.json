    "text": "Hungary “has not sufficiently addressed” concerns, so ban on Erasmus+ and Horizon Europe funding continues\nTwenty-one universities in Hungary will continue to be prevented from receiving funding from the EU’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme and its Erasmus+ academic mobility programme, the European Commission has announced.\nIts decision comes despite the country’s government informing the Commission on 2 December that it felt it had addressed EU concerns regarding the rule of law in the country, including the risk of conflicts of interest within the governing bodies that control the country’s 21 public universities.\nSome appointed members of the university boards have links to Hungary’s right-wing prime minister Viktor Orbán and his political party Fidesz. In light of this, the EU decided in late 2022 to prevent these universities from accessing its funding.\nIt has also suspended the payment of some regional cohesion funding, as well as funding from the EU’s Covid-19 recovery fund.\nAll of these blocks will remain in place, the Commission announced on 16 December, saying that Hungary’s legal remedies did not go far enough.\nConcerns not adequately addressed\n“The legislative amendments do not adequately address the outstanding concerns on conflicts of interests in the boards of public interest trusts. On that basis, the Commission concluded that the measure on public interest trusts and entities maintained by them should remain in place. The Commission clearly outlined adaptations that would be needed to sufficiently remedy the situation,” it said.\n“Hungary can, at any time, adopt and notify new remedies to demonstrate to the Commission that the measures adopted by the Council should be adapted or lifted.”\nThe news website Politico reported that the Hungarian government said the motivation to continue the funding freeze was “purely political” and “discriminatory”, arguing the Commission was making “pawns” out of researchers and students.\nThe new EU education and skills commissioner, Roxana Mînzatu, said in her November confirmation hearing that the ball remained firmly in Hungary’s court to put forward sufficient proposals to release the funding.",
