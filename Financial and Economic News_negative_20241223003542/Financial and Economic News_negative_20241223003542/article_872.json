    "text": "Senator Confúcio Moura, the rapporteur for Brazil’s 2025 Budgetary Guidelines Bill, presented his report on Monday night, introducing significant changes to the government’s original proposal. The report is expected to be voted on by the Joint Budget Committee (CMO) this Tuesday and subsequently by the full Congress by Thursday.\nOne key change requires Brazil’s economic team to prioritize freezing public funds for most of 2025 to achieve the middle of the fiscal target range. Starting in November, the government would be allowed to aim for the lower limit of the fiscal target range, which permits a primary deficit of up to R$30.97 billion for the year.\nThe government’s initial proposal allowed it to focus solely on the lower fiscal limit throughout 2025, a rule also applied this year. This approach sparked criticism from economists who argued it weakened fiscal discipline as the budget was implemented.\nCost-cutting established by Brazil’s Fiscal Responsibility Act requires the government to freeze spending in ministries and congressional budget earmarks to ensure compliance with annual fiscal targets. Under Brazil’s new fiscal framework, these targets now include a tolerance range instead of a single fixed number.\nThe report also introduces stricter rules for the execution of special congressional budget transfers to municipalities, which have limited oversight. Under the proposal, if lawmakers fail to meet specific requirements, such as submitting detailed work plans or providing bank account information, the government can suspend these payments immediately.\n“The failure to comply with these requirements will result in the immediate suspension of transfers until they are regularized,” the report says. The measure aligns with a recent Supreme Court ruling by Justice Flávio Dino that called for greater transparency in these funds.\nAdditionally, the report requests lawmakers to provide an order of priority for their budget allocations, arguing that legislators are better positioned to determine the most urgent public needs in their constituencies. For allocations introduced by congressional committees, party leaders will determine priorities after consulting their caucuses.\nHowever, the system still leaves room for opacity, particularly in committee allocations. While these amendments effectively replaced the controversial “secret budget,” they maintain ambiguity regarding the real beneficiaries of the funds, empowering party leadership at the expense of transparency.\nThe report also addresses broader fiscal concerns, incorporating a proposal to include the federal government’s contributions to private funds in the Net Public Sector Debt (DLSP) and consolidated primary balance calculations. This measure targets programs like Pé de Meia, a financial aid initiative for students that currently operates outside Brazil’s spending cap and budget framework.\nSenator Moura also adopted two government suggestions.\nOne is to make adjustments to Party Fund calculations. Currently, the Party Fund is corrected for inflation and real revenue growth. The government proposed tying the fund to the 2023 budget level, adjusted only for inflation, which would reduce its value in 2025.\nThe other allows 17 state-owned enterprises that rely on National Treasury funding to establish “management contracts” with their supervisory ministries. This would remove their revenue from the federal budget, a change that has drawn criticism from experts concerned about reduced fiscal oversight.\nFinally, the report exempts federal universities from spending freezes and prohibits the government from blocking unpaid commitments in the Ministry of Education, safeguarding critical education funding.\nConfúcio Moura — Foto: Jefferson Rudy/Agência Senado This article was translated from Valor Econômico using an artificial intelligence tool under the supervision of the Valor International editorial team to ensure accuracy, clarity, and adherence to our editorial standards.
