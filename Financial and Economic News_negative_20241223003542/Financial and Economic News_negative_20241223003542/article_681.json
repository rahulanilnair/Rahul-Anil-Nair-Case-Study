    "text": "Crisis-hit[ Ferguson Marine](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/ferguson-marine) has been blasted by Scotland's public spending watchdog for forking out over £95K in golden goodbyes for former staff members. These taxpayer-funded payouts came despite the future of the Port Glasgow shipyard looking bleak with no contracts being won.\nThe only money being brought in by Ferguson Marine is from the Scottish Government to help it finish [the two much-delayed and over-budget ferries ](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/ferry-fiasco)being built there.[ The Glen Sannox was finally passed over to CalMac last month,](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/news/politics/delayed-glen-sannox-finally-handed-34157491) with the Glen Rosa remains incomplete.\nA damning report by the Auditor General criticised the lack of proper governance at the business, citing \"serious concerns\" and highlighting that decisions were made without informing the government. The former Chief Executive David Tydeman was slated for incorrectly changing a contract of an employee which meant the shipyard had to back-pay HMRC £48,000 in underpaid income tax.\nBut the biggest issue is the lack of cashflow within Ferguson Marine which is relying on the money being paid to construct the Glen Rosa. There are no contracts or work secured beyond this, meaning that redundancies and closure is a stark possibility, [with work on Glen Rosa being finished next September. ](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/news/politics/snp-ferry-shambles-glen-sannox-33887662)\nREAD MORE: [MSPs vote to spend £2m on free buses for asylum seekers despite Tory calls to stop 'woke' spending](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/news/politics/msps-vote-spend-2m-free-34296798)\nIts only guaranteed income is funding from the Scottish Government,[ with £14.7m being promised to future-proof the yard ](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/news/politics/kate-forbes-yet-decide-whether-34152488)but not being confirmed yet. It has been invited to apply for a contract with CalMac to deliver the small vessel replacement programme but it unlikely to win it.\nAudit Scotland's report said: \"During 2023/24, FMPG paid three exit packages above the £95,000 threshold set out in the Scottish Public Finance Manual (SPFM). Only one of the exit package payments, for the former chief executive, received advanced approval from the Scottish Government.\n\"FMPG subsequently notified SCAD of the other two exit packages, but the Scottish Government has not provided retrospective approval of these payments. The auditor has highlighted that this a significant deviation from the expected governance processes as outlined in the SPFM.\n\"FMPG has not been able to provide the auditor with any evidence documenting its decision-making in relation to employment termination and exit payments. As such, it is not possible to determine whether these decisions were made in line with the SPFM. For example, the SPFM is clear that settlement agreements should not be used to deal with poor performance or attendance.\"\nAudit general Stephen Boyle said: “The future of the Ferguson Marine Port Glasgow shipyard remains uncertain. Currently the yard hasn’t secured any future work or income, beyond the delivery of the Glen Rosa. We are again highlighting issues of inadequate governance and decision making. An independent review of governance arrangements needs to be swiftly actioned to ensure such poor decisions, without the right checks and balances, are not repeated.”\nSince it was nationalised, the shipyard has had almost £400m of public cash invested in it to keep it afloat and to keep it building the two ferries, which were meant to only cost £97m between the pair of them. The government is poised to plunge in £14.2m more assuming the proper legal, financial and commercial scrutiny processes are followed.\nThat work was meant to be completed by autumn but no announcement has yet been made. In the budget, £46m was allocated to Ferguson Marine but that is for completion of Glen Rosa.\nDeputy First Minister Kate Forbes insisted that she wanted to secure the future of the business. She said: \"Officials have been working with the Board to explore options to improve productivity and, as previously set out, we are willing to invest up to £14.2m over two years, subject to due diligence and provided commercial standards are met.\n“The draft 2025/26 Scottish Budget allocates £46m to Ferguson Marine for the completion of Glen Rosa and to cover the yard’s planned capital investment, subject to parliamentary approval. While we are already working with Ferguson Marine to strengthen governance arrangements, we note the Auditor General’s report and expect the board to carefully consider the points it raises.”\nScottish Liberal Democrat economy spokesperson Willie Rennie MSP said: “It has not been a year to inspire confidence in the running of Ferguson Marine. A Chief Executive sacked with the collaboration of government ministers for telling home truths they didn’t want to hear, an order book looking painfully thin and now fresh concerns over poor governance and decision-making.\n“In 2025, ministers and bosses need to help Ferguson Marine to turn a corner, with effective leadership and a programme of work to secure the yard’s future.\n“Islanders have had to put up with endless delays and taxpayers have been expected to foot a bill for hundreds of millions of pounds, yet still no one in government carries the can. This should be a case study for future ministers in how not to do things.”\nNever miss the latest top headlines from the Scottish Daily Express.
