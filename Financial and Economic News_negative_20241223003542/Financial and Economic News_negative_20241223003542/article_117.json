    "text": "The billionaire Isak Andic, founder and owner of the renowned fashion brand Mango, died today after falling into the void in the caves of Montserrat in the locality of Collbató, in Catalonia, during a hike with family members. The 71-year-old entrepreneur was with his son and wife when he slipped, falling from a height of 150 meters. It was the son who raised the alarm around 1:00 PM to the emergency service 112, which activated the rescue teams. This was learned from the emergency services. What is Mango, the brand of the deceased billionaire Isak Andic: born as a store in Barcelona, it has 2,000 outlets in 100 countries Falls into the void and dies: farewell to the founder of Mango A great sportsman and known worldwide for his prêt-à-porter fashion multinational, Isak Andic was undertaking a hike in the famous saltpeter caves that he had done on other occasions when he fell victim to an accident, according to Iberian media, including El Pais. During the route, according to what the son explained to the patrols that arrived on the scene, the entrepreneur was ahead of his family when they heard the sound of falling stones and saw Isak Andic falling into the void, unable to hold on. Mountain unit agents, who arrived on site with helicopters, managed to recover the lifeless body of the entrepreneur around 3:30 PM to transfer it to the Catalonia Institute of Legal Medicine, where it will undergo an autopsy. Who was Isak Andic Isak Andic created the Mango brand of the fashion empire that would make him famous worldwide in 1984. Of Turkish origin, he arrived in Spain as a teenager, opening his first store on Paseo de Gracia, in Barcelona. He was currently considered the richest man in Catalonia. “With deep sorrow, we regret to communicate the unexpected and painful death of Isak Andic, our non-executive president founder of Mango, in an accident that occurred on Saturday,” reported the company's CEO, Toni Ruiz, in a statement. “Isak was an example for all of us. He dedicated his life to the Mango project, leaving an indelible mark thanks to his strategic vision, inspiring leadership, and unwavering commitment to the values he instilled in our company,” he added. “His legacy reflects the outcomes of a successful entrepreneurial project, also for his human quality, his closeness, and the care and affection he transmitted to the entire organization at all times,” Ruiz also wrote in the text, with the commitment to “ensure that Mango continues to be the ambitious project of which Isak was proud.” Forbes estimated Andic's net worth to be $4.5bn.
