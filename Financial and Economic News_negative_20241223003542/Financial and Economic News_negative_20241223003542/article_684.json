That is an increase of 10 points compared to when similar polling was done last year.\nFour in 10 also plan to spend the same amount as last year — down nine points compared to October 2023 — while 11 per cent said they will increase their spending on gifts this time around, the Ipsos poll showed.\n“At the moment, it looks like people are approaching the holidays pretty cautiously and to the extent that people are moving past caution, it’s not to spend more, it’s to spend less,” said Darrell Bricker, global CEO of Ipsos public affairs.\nStory continues below advertisement 4:28 Retail analyst on 2024 holiday spending trends Financial pressures are weighing on the majority of Canadians’ holiday spending budget, with 76 per cent saying that inflation and interest rates have had a “significant impact.”\nOverall inflation has cooled in recent months, hitting Bank of Canada’s two per cent target in October, and interest rate is down to 3.25 per cent after five consecutive cuts. Yet, many Canadians are still continuing to feel a squeeze in their wallets.\nGet weekly money news Get expert insights, Q&A on markets, housing, inflation, and personal finance information delivered to you every Saturday.",
