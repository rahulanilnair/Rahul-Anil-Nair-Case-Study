We might see a drop of over 50% in December.”\nGold imports more than doubled in November compared to the previous month, reaching a record $14.8 billion, which widened the trade deficit to a record level and pushed the rupee to an all-time low.\nMany potential buyers had been waiting for gold prices to drop and rushed to make purchases as soon as prices corrected in November, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bullion importing bank.\nLocal prices declined to 73,300 rupees ($863) per 10 grams in mid-November after hitting a record high of 79,775 rupees in October.\nIndia’s gold demand to hit four-year low amid price rally, World Gold Council says\nPrices have rebounded in December, which is discouraging buyers and will likely lead to imports falling sharply to around $5 billion, the dealer said.\n“So far this month, we have received fewer gold consignments for clearing compared to last month,” said a customs official, who declined to be named.\nWeak demand prompted Indian dealers this week to offer a discount of up to $8 an ounce over official domestic prices – inclusive of 6% import and 3% sales levies.\nLast month, they were charging a premium of up to $16. In November, investment demand was robust as bullion was offering better returns than the stock market, IBJA’s Kothari said. India’s NSE Nifty 50 share index fell to 23,263.15 points in November, down 11% from a record high hit on Sept. 27.\nGold imports in November were also driven by festive season demand, as jewellers aimed to replenish stocks following the festivals of Dussehra and Diwali, said Amit Modak, chief executive of PN Gadgil & Sons, a jeweller.\nIndia Gold Spot gold LME gold india gold India gold imports Comments 200 characters Markets\nSelling pressure at PSX, KSE-100 down over 1,700 points",
