    "text": "The publicly-owned Ferguson Marine shipyard faces an \"uncertain\" future, a spending watchdog has warned.\nThe Port Glasgow yard has no work beyond the MV Glen Rosa, which is due to be delivered in September 2025.\nThe Auditor General for Scotland also criticised some recent redundancy payments and highlighted \"inadequate governance and decision-making\".\nA spokesman for Ferguson Marine said it remained optimistic that its bid for the Small Vessel Replacement Programme (SVRP) tender and other commercial activities would be successful.\nFerguson shipyard's interim boss extends contract Ferries saga ship Glen Sannox finally delivered Ferguson shipyard shortlisted for new small ferries contract Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said the Scottish government was committed to helping Ferguson Marine Port Glasgow (FMPG) reach a position where it could \"competitively bid for a range of projects and build a sustainable future\".\nThe shipyard has been at the centre of Scotland's long-running ferries saga but last month it finally delivered Glen Sannox , the first of two LNG ships being built for Caledonian MacBrayne.\nThe ships have been plagued by design and build problems, ending up four times over budget and six years late.\nJohn Petticrew, the interim boss of the yard, has agreed to stay on until Easter as the firm struggles to recruit a replacement chief executive.\nMr Petticrew recently told Holyrood's net zero energy and transport committee he believed a failure to properly design the ships before starting construction was at the heart of what went wrong.\nAuditor General for Scotland Stephen Boyle issued a bleak forecast for the Ferguson Marine yard In his report, Mr Boyle said no evidence was provided as to how FMPG decided to award two employees redundancy packages in excess of the £95,000 public sector threshold.\nIn such cases the views of ministers should have been sought, he said.\nAn internal investigation also revealed the yard's previous chief executive agreed changes to a seconded employee's contract without seeking approval from either the board or remuneration committee.\nAs well as being a failure of procedure, this resulted in FPMG having to pay back £48,000 to HMRC in underpaid income tax.\nMr Boyle said: \"The future of the Ferguson Marine Port Glasgow shipyard remains uncertain.\n\"Currently the yard hasn't secured any future work or income, beyond the delivery of the Glen Rosa.\n\"We are again highlighting issues of inadequate governance and decision-making.\"\nHe added that an independent review of governance arrangements needed to be \"swiftly actioned\" to ensure \"poor decisions\" were not repeated.\n'Not acceptable practice' The Auditor General said ongoing investment was needed to make the yard competitive and generate future income.\nAt the moment it only has guaranteed funding from the Scottish government up to 2026.\nThe report notes its business plan to 2029 had assumed direct award of the SVRP, but this was not possible due to UK subsidy laws.\nAs a result it now faces competition from five firms for the tender.\nFMPG said the issue in relation to the seconded employee followed \"proactive action\" by its chief financial officer and accountable officer, who alerted HMRC and repaid the money owed.\nA spokesperson added: \"The decision not to disclose this agreement – and two other payments to departing employees - to the FMPG Board or its remuneration committee is not acceptable practice at Ferguson Marine.\"\nThey also confirmed the individuals involved were no longer employed by FMPG.\nThe spokesperson added: \"Since uncovering the governance concerns, a significant amount of work has been undertaken to implement a robust programme of governance inspections and improvements, and we continue to make every effort to ensure that correct protocols are followed.\"\nMeanwhile, Kate Forbes said officials had been working with the board to explore options to improve productivity.\nAnd the deputy first minister said the government was willing to invest up to £14.2m over two years.\nShe said: \"The draft 2025/26 Scottish Budget allocates £46m to Ferguson Marine for the completion of Glen Rosa and to cover the yard's planned capital investment, subject to parliamentary approval.\n\"While we are already working with Ferguson Marine to strengthen governance arrangements, we note the Auditor General's report and expect the Board to carefully consider the points it raises.\"\nMore stories from Glasgow & West Scotland More stories from Scotland",
