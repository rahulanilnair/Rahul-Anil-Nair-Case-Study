    "text": "By Stacy M. Brown | NNPA (NNPA) – New complaint data from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) shows a staggering rise in online job scams, particularly schemes known as “task scams,” which now account for nearly 40% of job scam reports in 2024. The sharp increase in these fraudulent activities has driven overall losses to job scams to more than $220 million in just the first six months of this year.\nAccording to the FTC’s latest data spotlight, reports of task scams have skyrocketed from zero in 2020 to 5,000 in 2023, before quadrupling to 20,000 in the first half of 2024 alone. These scams typically begin with unsolicited texts or WhatsApp messages offering vague online work opportunities. Consumers who respond are told they will be completing tasks like “app optimization” or “product boosting.”\nVictims may receive small payouts early on to build confidence in the job’s legitimacy. The scheme then escalates, requiring victims to invest their money to complete subsequent tasks, promising more significant payouts. However, once the money is sent, it is lost for good.\n“The supposed ‘job’ is to complete tasks in an app or online platform for which you’ll ‘earn money’ from a ‘commission’ on each click,” the FTC warned in a consumer alert. “But those promises are fake: there aren’t any commissions, and nobody but the scammers make any money.”\nCryptocurrency is the primary method of payment in these scams. The FTC reported that task scams have significantly contributed to a surge in cryptocurrency-related losses, which reached $41 million in the first half of 2024—almost double the total for 2023.\nIn 2023, overall losses from online job scams totaled $286 million. By mid-2024, reported losses had already surpassed $220 million. Since many victims do not report these crimes, the FTC cautioned that these figures likely represent just a fraction of the damage.\nThe FTC highlighted specific red flags and offered advice to help consumers avoid falling victim to task scams:\nIgnore unsolicited messages : Real employers do not typically contact potential employees via generic texts or WhatsApp messages. Never pay to get paid : Any request for money upfront in exchange for future earnings is a clear sign of a scam. Be wary of “gamified” tasks : Offers to pay for liking or rating online content are illegal and usually fraudulent. Federal officials cautioned that the rise of “gamified job scams”—which lure victims with repetitive tasks like interacting with social media posts or rating businesses—has further amplified the threat. Victims often receive large batches of tasks, with promises of increased pay after completing multiple levels. These schemes culminate with demanding deposits to “unlock” their earnings, ultimately leading to financial losses.\n“No matter what the system says you earned, you didn’t,” the FTC report cautioned. “That money isn’t real. And if you deposit that money, you won’t get it back.”\nThe FTC’s data regarding job scams is alarming, according to officials. “We urge everyone to be cautious and skeptical of too-good-to-be true offers,” the FTC concluded. “Protecting yourself starts with staying informed and recognizing the red flags.”",
