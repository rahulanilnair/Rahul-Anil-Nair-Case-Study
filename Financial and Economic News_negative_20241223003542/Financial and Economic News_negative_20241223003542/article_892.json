    "text": "Electricity transmission may become more expensive in Ukraine: how it will affect tariffs.\nThe electricity transmission tariff will increase\nThe National Commission for State Regulation in the Fields of Energy and Utilities (NKREKP) has published a draft resolution proposing an increase in the electricity transmission tariff by 30%, to UAH 686.23/MWh, for users of the system, excluding 'green' electric metallurgy enterprises.\nThe regulator planned to set the tariff for 2025 at UAH 678.58/MWh, but the consideration of the issue was postponed for refinement. The updated draft resolution now provides for a tariff of UAH 686.23/MWh for most users of the system and UAH 359.55/MWh for 'green' metallurgists.\nThe proposed tariff mainly consists of costs for the fulfillment of special obligations, including the service of ensuring an increase in the share of electricity from alternative sources, except for private households. The forecast average 'green' tariff for the next year will be UAH 6437/MWh.\n'Ukrenergo' plans to spend UAH 14.9 billion next year on purchasing electricity to compensate for technological costs. Most of the electricity will be purchased under bilateral contracts, and the remainder will be on the RDN and balancing market. In 2024, expenditures for this item amounted to UAH 12.8 billion.\nBusinesses have opposed the tariff increase. The Ukrainian Association of Ferroalloy Producers and other electrotechnology products stated that this will lead to increased costs. The Association of Building Materials Producers also warned about price increases. The costs to businesses from the tariff increase were estimated at UAH 13 billion.\nRead also\n[Electronics, lamps, toys: Ukrainians named the most dangerous products of 2024](https://112.ua/en/elektronika-lampi-igraski-ukraincam-nazvali-najnebezpecnisi-tovari-2024-roku-49548)[Pension Indexation: Who Among Ukrainians Will Receive Payments Over 10 Thousand in 2025](https://112.ua/en/indeksacia-pensij-hto-z-ukrainciv-otrimae-viplati-ponad-10-tisac-u-2025-roci-49550)[Supermarkets updated prices for salt, sugar, and flour in mid-December](https://112.ua/en/supermarketi-onovili-cini-na-sil-cukor-ta-borosno-u-seredini-grudna-49535)[Ukrainians explained how long they will have to live with power outage schedules](https://112.ua/en/ukraincam-poasnili-skilki-dovedetsa-ziti-iz-grafikami-vidklucenna-svitla-49537)[30 dollars for a pack: Ukrainians were shown prices for cigarettes in other countries](https://112.ua/en/30-dolariv-za-packu-ukraincam-pokazali-cini-na-cigarki-v-insih-krainah-49540)[YASNO announced how to pay for electricity with cashback from the government](https://112.ua/en/u-yasno-rozpovili-ak-splatiti-za-elektroenergiu-kesbekom-vid-derzavi-49541)",
