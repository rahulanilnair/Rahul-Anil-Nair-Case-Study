The trade-body has expressed its dismay with the current government, stating in a press release that the salmon farm closures is based on \"political gimmicks\" as opposed to sound policy.\n\"Despite clear scientific evidence, the decision to ban current marine net-pen salmon farming in British Columbia by 2029 is driven by political motivations rather than long-term, responsible planning. This policy ignores the real-world consequences for thousands of workers, First Nation communities, and the broader economy,\" stated the BCSFA, in a press release.\nBC salmon farmers are also expressing concerns regarding food security for the country following the phase-out of net-pens, claiming that the closures will result in the loss of 400 million meals a year.\n\"The BCSFA calls on the Trudeau government to rethink this reckless course of action and work directly with Rightsholder First Nation communities to find a path prioritising job creation, economic growth, and long-term sustainability. It’s time for the government to listen to workers and communities dependent on this sector and their own public service rather than bowing to political pressure from anti-salmon farming activist groups,\" the statement concludes.\nRecent features 2024 in review Steven Hermans Husbandry 16 December 2024 The free solution to seafood carbon footprinting Fisheries 13 December 2024 Meet the founders Joining the dots in Kenya's aquaculture value chain Formulated feed 11 December 2024 Latest stories Nofima makes progress towards algae-based aquafeeds Feed ingredients 16 December 2024 eFishery suspends its founders Regulations 16 December 2024 200 exhibitors confirmed for Aquafuture Spain 2025 Marketing 16 December 2024 US Department of Energy funds $2.5 m algae-for-aquafeed project Feed ingredients 13 December 2024",
