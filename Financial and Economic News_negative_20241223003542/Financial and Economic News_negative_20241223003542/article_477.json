    "text": "Tuesday, BofA Securities adjusted its stance on Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL), shifting the rating from Buy to Neutral despite raising the price target to $39.00 from $35.00. The revision follows Exelixis' remarkable performance, with the stock surging 65.6% over the past six months and currently trading near its 52-week high of $36.97.\nThis outperformance against the broader biotech sector is attributed to a recent intellectual property victory concerning its cancer drug Cabozantinib (Cabo) and a positive third-quarter update for 2024. According to InvestingPro data, the company's strong momentum has contributed to an impressive 54% return over the past year.\nThe analyst from BofA Securities noted the change in rating is due to a more balanced risk/reward scenario for Exelixis, given the stock's recent run-up. The company maintains a strong financial position, with InvestingPro analysis showing an overall GREAT financial health score and robust revenue growth of 17.3% in the last twelve months.\nWith Cabo, Exelixis' leading oncology asset, now in a mature stage of its product lifecycle, the firm's attention is shifting towards the generation of clinical data aimed at diversifying Exelixis' portfolio. This includes a focus on Zanza, the company's next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).\nLooking ahead, BofA Securities anticipates Exelixis to be catalyst-light in the year 2025 for three primary reasons. First, the only phase 3 data catalyst for Zanza is in late-line colorectal cancer, which is expected to be less than $500 million in peak sales and appears to be already factored into the current stock price.\nSecond, the ongoing phase 1/2 basket trial is considered exploratory and early-stage, offering limited immediate impact. Lastly, while Cabo's potential label expansion into neuroendocrine tumors is likely, it is not expected to contribute significantly to the company's net present value.\nIn summary, the analyst's downgrade reflects a view that the recent positive developments for Exelixis have been adequately reflected in the company's stock price, leading to a more cautious outlook on the potential for near-term growth drivers.\nIn other recent news, Exelixis Inc (NASDAQ: EXEL ). has been the subject of noteworthy developments. The company has reported a 9% increase in net product revenues in its Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call, reaching $478 million, marking a 12% increase year-over-year. This positive performance has led Exelixis to raise its full-year revenue guidance for 2024, with projections suggesting that U.S. sales could approach $3 billion by 2030.\nOn the regulatory front, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has scheduled an Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) meeting for March 2025 to discuss Exelixis's supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for CABOMETYX. The FDA's decision on the label expansion approval for CABOMETYX is expected by April 3, 2025.\nIn terms of analyst ratings, Stephens has reiterated an Equal Weight rating for Exelixis, maintaining a $29.00 price target. The firm's stance comes amid anticipation of the outcome of the ODAC review, which could impact CABOMETYX's market growth and the company's future.\nIn addition to these developments, Exelixis is also expanding its oncology portfolio, including a collaboration with Merck (NS: PROR ) for zanzalintinib.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
