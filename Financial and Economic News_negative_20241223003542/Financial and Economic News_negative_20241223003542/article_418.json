Speaking to Kashmir News Service, Karra said that the state relies heavily on hydropower, which depends on adequate rainfall. \"For months, there has been little to no rain, directly impacting power generation. Most of our electricity is produced through hydropower plants, and the lack of rainfall has significantly reduced generation levels,\" he explained. Karra also highlighted the importance of electricity being supplied from the National Grid. He pointed out that during winters, Kashmir depends on the National Grid, while in summers, the supply is crucial for Jammu. \"We need to see whether electricity is coming from the National Grid or not.Click Here To Follow Our WhatsApp ChannelThe availability from this source must be ensured to meet the rising demand in both regions,\" he said. Highlighting governance issues, Karra raised concerns about confusion over decision-making powers in the UT’s electricity sector. \"There is uncertainty about who holds authority over power generation and distribution in the UT—whether it is the LG administration or the state government. This confusion stems from the business rules not being clearly defined,\" he added. Karra stressed that resolving these issues is essential to avoid disruptions in electricity supply. \"Once the business rules are clarified, this confusion may end, and electricity management can improve,\" he concluded.
