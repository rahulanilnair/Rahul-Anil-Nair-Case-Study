    "text": "A charity has warned a council in Devon could be in danger of not getting £4m in government funding if it does not act to help house care-leavers sufficiently.\nYMCA Exeter said the funding could not be accessed if Torbay Council could not help it develop 36 affordable accommodation places in Paignton for care-experienced young people.\nSpeaking at a council meeting on 9 December, Councillor Swithin Long said it would be \"an absolute tragedy\" if the money was lost.\nA Torbay Council spokesperson said: \"All planning applications must be considered according to their individual circumstances and take into account relevant national and local planning policies.\"\nPrevious plans rejected They added the authority would continue to work closely with Homes England and partners to discuss the delivery of the project's allocated funding.\nA previous proposal presented by YMCA Exeter, which was rejected on 14 October, would have provided 18 homes for local young people in Paignton.\nThe council voted to reject the development over concerns that the properties sat in a core tourism area.\nYMCA Exeter said the only way for the funding to be obtained was to get 36 units up and running by the end of March.\nLast Wednesday, young people gathered to plant 469 flags around the Care Leavers Tree at Victoria Park in Paignton.\nThe display represented the number of care experienced young people currently in Torbay.\nAndy Fletcher, 31, was in care from the age of eight to 18 and now volunteers as a YMCA Exeter Ambassador.\nHe said: \"I'd honestly be dead without YMCA Exeter.\n\"My journey has been about maturing as a person. Today I can look back and see the difference in my life.\"\nFollow BBC Devon on X , Facebook and Instagram .
