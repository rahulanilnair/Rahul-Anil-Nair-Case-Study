    "text": "By Kate Devlin ,\n12 minutes ago Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) campaigners stage a protest on College Green in Westminster, London (Jordan Pettitt/PA) PA Wire Women affected by changes to the state pension age will not receive compensation , under what ministers said was an \"extremely difficult decision to take\".\nWork and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall rejected calls for individuals affected to get £1,000 to £2,950 per person, while claiming she understood the unhappiness of those affected by the issue .\n\"I know there are women born in the 1950s who want and deserve a better life, they have worked hard in paid jobs and in bringing up their families,” she said.\n\"Many are struggling financially with the cost of living and fewer savings to fall back on, and they worry about their health and how their children and grandchildren will get on.\n\"To those women I say, this Government will protect the pensions triple lock, so your state pension will increase by up to £1,900 per year by the end of this Parliament.\n\"We’ll drive down waiting lists so you get the treatment you need with an extra £22 billion of funding for the NHS this year and next. And we’ll deliver the jobs, homes and opportunities your families need to build a better life. I know that on this specific decision, many 1950s-born women will be disappointed, but we believe it is the right decision and the fair decision.\"\nBut the Lib Dems said the decision was a “day of shame for the government”.\nMore follows on this breaking news story....",
