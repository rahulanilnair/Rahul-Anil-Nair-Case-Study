    "text": "Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save For maybe the first time ever, I agree with Roger Koopman. His Dec. 10 tariff criticism hits the bull's-eye describing proposed Trump tariffs as a bad idea.\nI practiced international trade law for 12 years in Washington, D.C., representing U.S. and international clients. I then taught it at the University of Montana and various overseas law and business schools for 25 more. I also advised multiple governments, including ours, on their trade agreement pros and cons. In this process I became something of a self-taught expert on international trade history, economics and politics. These experiences taught me two lessons.\nFirst, high tariffs caused the 1930s global depression which took World War II to end, and even helped trigger the War itself. When global trade came to a screeching halt after countries imposed retaliatory protectionist tariffs in response to high U.S. tariffs, Germany, Italy, and especially Japan decided to seize other countries’ national resources they could not acquire in the international marketplace; while Britain and France exercised their broad colonial powers to keep their colonies’ natural resources for themselves and starved the people in those colonies.\nPeople are also reading… Montana's public lands at risk: A threat to hunters and heritage | Mike Mershon A Montana hospital let Dr. Thomas Weiner continue practicing despite concerns Property owners appeal elk lawsuit to Montana Supreme Court Hit show ‘Yellowstone’ doesn’t just portray ranching in Montana.

When Koopman, most top experts and I agree on anything, we may all be right.\nDavid Aronofsky,\nMissoula",
