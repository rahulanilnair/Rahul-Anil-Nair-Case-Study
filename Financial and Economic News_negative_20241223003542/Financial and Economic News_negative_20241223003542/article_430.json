    "text": "By Emese Bartha\nGermany's overall debt issuance will decline in 2025 from 2024, the German Finance Agency said in its funding plan for next year on Tuesday.\nThe German federal government plans to issue a total volume of around 380 billion euros ($399.51 billion) in federal securities in 2025 via auctions, it said. Additionally, the Finance Agency expects two syndicated transactions next year, including one for a new 30-year Bund, it said.\nNext year's planned overall issuance will decline from 438.5 billion euros issued in 2024, Tammo Diemer, head of the Finance Agency, said in a webinar. This volume includes issuance via auctions of conventional bonds, green bonds, treasury bills and syndicated issues.\nThe overall auction volume in 2025 includes 240 billion euros to be issued in conventional bonds via auctions, while a further 126 billion euros will be sold via treasury bills, or Bubills, on the money market, the Finance Agency said.\nGreen bond issuance is expected to amount to 13 billion euros to 15 billion euros in 2025, it said, adding that a new 10-year green Bund is envisaged. The German Finance Agency plans eight auctions for green bonds, and multi-tranche auctions are also possible.\nGermany currently has an outstanding of 73.25 billion euros in eight green bonds, Diemer said.\nIn terms of conventional bonds to be sold via auctions, the Finance Agency plans 16 issues for two-year treasury notes, or Schatz, with a total volume of 70.5 billion euros.\nAn issuance volume of 62.5 billion euros is planned in five-year federal notes, or Bobl.\nIn the 10-year maturity segment, the Finance Agency plans total issuance of 64 billion euros, including two new bonds to be issued.\nNine reopening dates are planned for outstanding 15-year Bunds with a total volume of 17 billion euros, the Finance Agency said. No new 15-year Bund will be launched next year, Diemer said.\nA total of 26 billion euros will be sold in 11 issues of 30-year Bunds.\nGermany will not issue 7-year Bunds next year.\nWrite to Emese Bartha at emese.bartha@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n12-17-24 0629ET\nShare Â© Dow Jones - 2024",
