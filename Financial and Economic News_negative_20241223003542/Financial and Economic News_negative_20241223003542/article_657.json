    "text": "2024-12-16 16:31:00\nSomehow one imagined that this stock market year would be different in Paris. Until late spring, the performance of the main French index CAC 40 kept pace with that of the Dax and the Nasdaq. The businesses of the driving forces LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy), Hermès and L’Oréal were thriving and promised to continue growing strongly. Their prices traded at record highs and drove up the CAC 40, where the three luxury and cosmetics giants together account for more than 30% of the weight.\nBut the spring joy was followed by a months-long malaise that continues to this day. While the Dax has gained more than 20% and the Nasdaq even more than 30% since the beginning of the year, the CAC 40 has lost around 2%. One of the main reasons is the unexpectedly weak Chinese activity of manufacturers of “Made in France” bags, perfumes and body care products.\nLuxury continues to be in demand in Asia\nHermès ultra-luxury is still in demand in the Far East, but mass luxury sells poorly. LVMH reported a 16% sales decline in the third quarter in its most important business region, Asia, excluding Japan. Investors punished the group and the market value fell to just over 300 billion euros. In March it was just under 450 billion euros.\nThe latent political uncertainty in France is also a burden. It continues today and will probably disappear only when the new parliamentary elections produce a clearer majority, which in turn, according to the Constitution, cannot take place before the beginning of next summer. Late last week, President Emmanuel Macron appointed François Bayrou as his fourth prime minister this year. It is not certain whether he will be able to do what his predecessor Michel Barnier, ousted with a vote of no confidence, failed to do, that is, bring the shattered state finances under control despite resistance from all possible parties.\nThere is no shortage of pressure to act as the EU’s second-largest economy comes increasingly under the scrutiny of financial markets. A few hours after Bayrou’s appointment, the rating agency Moody’s lowered France’s credit rating from “Aa2” to “Aa3”. “It’s the receipt of the political theater of the last few weeks,” commented economist Armin Steinbach, who teaches at the HEC business school in Paris. The risk premium on French government bonds rose slightly to 80 basis points on Monday. Before parliament was dissolved in June, its value was less than 50 points.\nPolitical instability\nThe French economy is mainly affected by the fact that tax legislation in particular remains unpredictable due to political instability. The activity of the CAC 40 companies is highly internationalized with a foreign share of approximately 75%. For the 120 largest French companies listed on the stock exchange, analysts at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management estimate the foreign share at 83%. But simply because of their French tax headquarters, even the most internationalized large companies cannot completely isolate themselves from what happens in their home country.\nThe Barnier government’s failed austerity budget included, among other things, a billion-dollar special tax on large corporations, which would cost LVMH 700 to 800 million euros next year. It remains to be seen whether additional charges like these are now permanently out of the question. It is possible that they will even be tightened further during new budget discussions in January due to pressure from left-wing parties; This week the French Parliament will only discuss a provisional budget, which will initially update this year’s income and expenditure.\nBusiness associations are increasingly raising the alarm about these imponderables. Especially since it is not just the luxury goods sector that is struggling with economic obstacles from China, but the entire economy. The president of the Medef employers’ association, Patrick Martin, sees the economy already in a “slight recession” following Barnier’s fall at the beginning of December. Two things are particularly worrying: the record number of 66,000 bankruptcy filings this year and the fact that, according to a survey by consultancy EY, 49% of foreign investors have reduced or postponed their investment plans in France as a result of the dissolution of parliament. Furthermore, deindustrialization is progressing, as evidenced by the fact that industrial production capacity utilization has fallen to 75%. “Chemistry, steel production and the automotive industry are on the back burner,” Martin warned.\nThe economic situation was not as bad as in Germany recently. In the third quarter, growth was dynamic at 0.4%, for the entire year +1.1% is still possible according to the latest OECD forecasts. However, the French central bank expects growth to slow down in the current fourth quarter and, due to persistent uncertainty, more and more forecasts are being revised downwards. French people’s concern about the economic situation is currently as high as it was during the coronavirus pandemic, Elabe pollsters found a few days ago.\n#sight #French #malaise",
