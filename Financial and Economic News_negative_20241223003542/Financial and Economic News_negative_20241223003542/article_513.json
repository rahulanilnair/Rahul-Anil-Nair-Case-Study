    "text": "(Alliance News) - At mid-day Tuesday, major European indexes march into negative territory, with Piazza Affari below 34,500. Purchases are affected by weak data in China and German inflation. Investors are now setting their eyes on U.S. inflation and the ECB's decision regarding interest rates.\nThe eurozone economy continues to suffer from fragility, exacerbated by political uncertainty in France and Germany and geopolitical risks related to the election of Donald Trump. ECB President Christine Lagarde expressed concern in a parliamentary hearing, warning of a possible slowdown in growth in the coming months and stressing that downside risks prevail over the medium-term outlook.\nThus, the FTSE Mib gives up 0.3 percent to 34,450.68, the Mid-Cap is down 0.1 percent to 47,993.48, the Small-Cap is down 0.3 percent to 28,389.95, and Italy Growth is down 0.3 percent to 7,772.75.\nIn Europe, London's FTSE 100 is in the red by 0.6 percent as is Paris' CAC 40, while Frankfurt's DAX 40 is back 0.1 percent.\nOn the macroeconomic front, in Italy, Istat estimates that industrial production in October remained stable compared to September, while in the average of the August-October quarter it fell by 0.7 percent.

Barclays upgraded the stock to 'overweight' from 'equal weight' with target price at EUR0.32.\nStellantis--in the green by 0.4 percent--announced a business plan for the future of Italian factories, proposing a pact with component companies to tackle the green transition together, according to a Tuesday report by Repubblica.\nJean-Philippe Imparato, head of Europe at Stellantis, said Italy is central to the group's strategy, with Mirafiori at the center of production. The plant will continue to produce the Fiat 500, including the hybrid in 2025 and the new electric generation in 2032-33, with an estimated increase of 100,000 cars.\nMeanwhile, Tim Kuniskis, a longtime Marchionne-era manager, is returning to Stellantis to take over the Ram Truck brand, a few months after he retired in May, Milano Finanza reported Tuesday.\nEnel gives up 0.2 percent to EUR6.91. Flavio Cattaneo, chief executive officer of Enel and vice chairman of Endesa, increased the total value of his holdings of shares in the two companies to about EUR32.0 million, according to Il Messaggero in Tuesday's edition.\nGenerali -- in the red by 0.4 percent -- acquired Palazzo Carciotti in Trieste, the historic insurance headquarters, for EUR13.2 million.\nSnam, down 0.5 percent, announced Tuesday the subscription of a new Sustainability-linked revolving credit facility for a total amount of EUR4.00 billion, with an option to increase to EUR1.10 billion.\nMediobanca Private Banking, a division of the Mediobanca Group -- in the red by 0.7 percent -- raised EUR484.0 million for an innovative real estate co-investment program developed in collaboration with Mediobanca SGR and UBS Asset Management, Il Sole 24 Ore reported Tuesday.\nAt the bottom of the main list, Leonardo zeroes out its opening gains and gives up 1.3 percent, after ending Monday's session in the red by 4.8 percent. The possible cut announced by President-elect Trump to military aid for Ukraine weighs on the stock.\nOn the Mid-Cap, Anima Holding rose 1.1 percent in mid-session after the Caltagirone group increased its stake from 3.2 percent to 5.3 percent, consolidating Italian control over the asset management company that administers EUR205.2 billion, Corriere della Sera reported Tuesday.\nFincantieri - in the red by 1.3 percent - announced the relaunch of its Foundation with new missions, including defense of cultural heritage, innovation and social inclusion, renewing its board of directors.\nOVS - in the red by 1.8 percent - submitted a bid to take over Conbipel, a historic clothing chain with 130 stores and about 800 employees, Corriere della Sera reported Monday.\nStill buying for Digital Value, up 4.6 percent in its sixth bullish session, continuing the positive performance of the past 30 days.\nAmong the opening bearishers are WIIT and GVS, with declines between 1.7 percent and 2.7 percent.\nOn the Small-Cap, Beghelli's flight continues, up 42% to EUR0.329 per share.
