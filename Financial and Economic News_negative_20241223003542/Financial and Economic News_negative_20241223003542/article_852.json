    "text": "By MIKE SHEEN\nUpdated: 12:11 GMT, 17 December 2024\nTullow Oil shares plunged on Tuesday after Kosmos Energy abandoned the takeover pursuit of its London-listed rival.\nThe two firms confirmed preliminary talks over an all-share takeover last week in the wake of media speculation, but Kosmos has now said it does not intend to make a formal offer.\nKosmos gave no explanation as to why, leaving question marks over the future of West Africa-focused Tullow.\nIt had been hoped the deal would offer compelling operational synergies as the pair share the same core assets – the Jubilee and TEN fields in offshore Ghana – and help repair Tullow’s balance sheet.\nTullow has been fighting to overcome an enormous debt pile, which it hopes to have reduced to $1.4billion by the end of the year.\nIt has seen its valuation plunge from some £15billion at its 2012 peak to a market capitalisation of just £339million today, according to LSEG data.\nA Tullow Oil drill on the Jubilee field, offshore Ghana.\nThe group was on a winning streak of major oil field discoveries in Ghana and Uganda during the noughties, but this abruptly came to an end. Debts skyrocketed after a number of unsuccessful exploration attempt.\nThe global race to net zero has also increasingly been damaging, with Tullow in recent years gradually calling an end to its exploration efforts to focus on effectively managing existing assets.\nTullow’s existing strategy aims to have less than $1billion in net debt by 2025 and cash gearing below 1x in the near term.\nKosmos has production operations and exploration opportunities offshore Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and in the deepwater US Gulf of Mexico.\nThe US firm, which itself has $2.7billion of net debt, pumped 65,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, compared to Tullow’s efforts of 63,700 barrels per day over the first half of the year.\nTullow Oil shares were down 10.6 per cent to 20.84p approaching midday. The shares have lost more than 40 per cent over the last year.\nDIY INVESTING PLATFORMS AJ Bell AJ Bell Easy investing and ready-made portfolios\nHargreaves Lansdown Hargreaves Lansdown Free fund dealing and investment ideas\ninteractive investor interactive investor Flat-fee investing from £4.99 per month\nSaxo Saxo Get £200 back in trading fees\nTrading 212 Trading 212 Free dealing and no account fee\nAffiliate links: If you take out a product This is Money may earn a commission.
