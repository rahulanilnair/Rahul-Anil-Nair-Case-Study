    "text": "THE House of Representatives Murang Pagkain Supercommittee on Tuesday issued a stern warning to supermarkets and major rice retailers, indicating that the five-committee panel will soon investigate possible price manipulation and profiteering at the retail level.\nAlbay Rep. Jose Clemente “Joey” Sarte Salceda, the lead chairman of the supercommittee, underscored concerns that certain supermarkets are mislabeling imported rice as premium varieties, drastically inflating prices.\n“I am warning supermarkets and big groceries. We have received reports that imported well-milled rice is being labeled as premium rice and sold at P70 per kilo in supermarkets. That means they earn as much as P30 per kilo,” Salceda said, as he announced that supermarket and grocery representatives will be summoned once the QuintaComm reconvenes for further investigation into these irregularities.\nAggressive actions\nAT the same time, the leadership of the House of Representatives has launched a firm stand against profiteers, hoarders, and smugglers, promising aggressive actions from Congress to stabilize food prices and guarantee affordable goods.\nSpeaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez vowed that Congress would take aggressive steps to stabilize food prices and ensure affordable basic goods for Filipinos.\n“The government has done its part. we recently cut tariffs for imported rice from 35 to 15 percent. There is an abundance of supply, yet the prices remain high. Why?” Romualdez asked. “We need to find answers and hold those responsible accountable.”\nIn a stern warning, Romualdez pledged decisive action against unscrupulous traders and profiteers.\n“To those manipulating prices—especially this Christmas season—Congress will go after you. We will not tolerate these abuses,” the Speaker said.\nHe highlighted the role of the Murang Pagkain Super Committee in the fight against price manipulation, smuggling, and rising hunger. The committee, composed of five powerful panels—Ways and Means, Trade and Industry, Agriculture and Food, Social Services, and Food Security—serves as a united force to expose irregularities and strengthen government programs.\n“Our aim is to bring food prices to reasonable levels. This is about ensuring affordable rice and quality food for every Filipino,” Romualdez said.\nHe said the super committee is now working closely with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Bureau of Customs (BOC), and Department of Agriculture (DA) to conduct inspections of warehouses suspected of hoarding rice and other staples.\nDiscrepancies\nSALCEDA also pointed out discrepancies in market pricing, citing data that highlights excessive price markups occurring between the wholesale and retail stages of rice distribution.\n“We are inviting them next when the QuintaComm reconvenes,” he said.\n“We disaggregated market returns, and as much as 48 percent of excess returns are at the wholesale to retail level,” the lawmaker said.\nRejecting explanations offered by the Bureau of Plant Industry and the Grains Retailers Confederation of the Philippines (Grecon), Salceda challenged claims that price hikes are driven by consumer demand for premium rice.\n“I do not believe in the excuse given by both the Bureau of Plant Industry and Grecon that the reason for stubborn price increases is consumer preferences for premium rice. We checked the latest reference values, and even the highest quality rice from Vietnam is just P41 per kilo after duties. That doesn’t explain why prices are stubborn at P56,” Salceda explained.\nHe added that the average import price of rice remains around P31 per kilo after duties—far from the threshold of what could justifiably be considered “premium price.”\n“So, next time I get a reason like that, the committee will be forced to remind people that there are consequences to lying under oath,” Salceda added.",
