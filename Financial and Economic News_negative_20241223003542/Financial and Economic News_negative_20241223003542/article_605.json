    "text": "'Diminishing returns': Why the 'sickly' American Dream keeps 'shrinking'\nThe cast of \"The Donna Reed Show\" in 1960 (Wikimedia Commons) Alex Henderson December 17, 2024 Economy\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Joe Biden era is ending with low unemployment. The BLS, on December 6, reported that the United States' unemployment rate was only 4.2 percent in November.\nYet many Americans continue to be frustrated over the high cost of living.
