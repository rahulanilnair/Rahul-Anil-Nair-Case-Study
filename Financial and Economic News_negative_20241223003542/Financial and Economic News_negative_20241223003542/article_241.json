    "text": "SINGAPORE - The Straits Times Index (STI) faltered on Dec 17, mirroring declines in the region.\nIt ended down 0.6 per cent or 21.1 points at 3,799.93.\nAcross the broader market, decliners outnumbered advancers 275 to 194, with 890.1 million shares worth $1.1 billion changing hands.\nThe trio of local banks closed down on Dec 17, with UOB leading the lot, falling 1.3 per cent, or 50 cents, to $36.70. OCBC Bank ended down 0.3 per cent or five cents at $16.95, while DBS shed 0.2 per cent or 10 cents to $44.21.\nThe top gainer was Frasers Centrepoint Trust, up 1 per cent or two cents to $2.12.\nThe top loser was Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, down 2.1 per cent or six cents to $2.82.\nAcross the region, major indexes continued their declines, with the Kospi falling 1.3 per cent and the Nikkei 225 closing down 0.2 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index ended 0.5 per cent lower, while the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index lost 0.6 per cent.\nWall Street has surged as the Federal Reserve is expected to trim interest rates by 25 basis points. A backdrop of the US economy’s expansion, the most vigorous since October 2021, could ignite “animal spirits” in a post-election frenzy, noted Mr Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management,\nThis is in contrast to the Asian markets, which have faltered, disappointed by China’s latest data releases. The cautious stance from investors is further compounded by unsettling political developments in the major economies, including the unexpected resignation of Canada’s finance minister and the German chancellor losing a vote of confidence.\n“The US market atmosphere was decidedly upbeat, especially the Nasdaq, which soared to its 36th record close of the year, buoyed by the enduring ‘There is no alternative’ sentiment,” said Mr Innes.
