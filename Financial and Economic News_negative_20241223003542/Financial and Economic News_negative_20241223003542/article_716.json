    "text": "Following the release of UK wage data, the currency market has reduced expectations for the Bank of England's interest rate cuts in 2025. Traders now anticipate a total rate cut of approximately 59 basis points by December 2025, equivalent to two 25 basis point reductions. The likelihood of three rate cuts has decreased to less than 40%, down from 90% before the data release.\nUK Wage Data Lowers Expectations for 2025 Bank of England Rate Cuts\n1 hours ago\nDisclosures\nI/We may personally own shares in some of the companies mentioned above.
