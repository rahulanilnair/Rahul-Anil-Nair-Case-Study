    "text": "Major stock markets mostly fell Tuesday as attention turned to the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy decision, with traders hoping for guidance on its interest rate plans as president-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office.\nWall Street ended mostly on the front foot Monday, with a surge in tech giants helping the Nasdaq to a record high, but Asia was unable to pick up the baton Tuesday.\nLondon slid in late morning deals as official data showing a jump in UK wages growth cemented forecasts that the Bank of England will avoid cutting interest rates this week.\nParis and Frankfurt rose, as investors looked past news that German business confidence this month hit the lowest level since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\nBitcoin traded close to a record high of almost $107,791 reached Monday on continued optimism that Trump will introduce measures to deregulate the cryptocurrency market.\nOil prices retreated, hit by concerns that China's struggling economy will impact demand for crude.\n\"Investors are awaiting the latest Federal Reserve decision ahead of which the retail sales release later today could provide some colour as to the current level of consumer spending around Black Friday and the traditionally crucial festive decision,\" noted Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.\nThe Fed is expected to lower borrowing costs Wednesday before a rate announcement also due out of Japan this week.\nInvestors are keeping tabs on Beijing after Chinese leaders' latest measures to kickstart the economy fell short of expectations, with weak retail sales data Monday reinforcing the need for more support.\nThe Fed is widely expected to lower rates for the third meeting in a row as it looks to guide the world's top economy to a soft landing, though its statement will be pored over for clues about next year's outlook.\n- Tariffs fallout - Investors have started paring their bets on how many times the Fed will cut over the next 12 months owing to still-sticky inflation, a strong labour market and uncertainty about Trump, who has pledged to slash taxes and impose tariffs on imports.\nCanada's Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland quit Monday in a surprise move after disagreeing with Justin Trudeau over US president-elect Donald Trump's tariff threats.\nThe resignation of Freeland, who also stepped down as finance minister, marked the first open dissent against Prime Minister Trudeau from within his cabinet, and may threaten his hold on power.\nThat pushed the Canadian dollar to the lowest level against the US dollar since April 2020.\nIn her letter, Freeland said the country needed to take Trump's tariffs threats \"extremely seriously\".\nWarning that it could lead to a \"tariff war\" with the United States, she said Ottawa must keep its \"fiscal powder dry\".\nMore from this section Ex-husband in French rape trial asks 'forgiveness' from family",
