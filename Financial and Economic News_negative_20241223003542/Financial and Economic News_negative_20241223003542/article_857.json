    "text": "Newsletters\nAnmol Jain\nDec 17, 2024, 06:54 PM | Updated 06:54 PM IST\nSave & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the Swarajya app.\nGround Report From Agra (UP)\nDear Reader,\nIn Uttar Pradesh, power distribution companies (DISCOMs) are grappling with a staggering Rs 1.1 lakh crore debt, and itâ€™s not just about operational costs.\nSwarajya's Ankit Saxena was in Agra and his ground report on the issue brings out some startling insights:\nGovernment institutions, including police stations, owe a huge chunk of unpaid dues.\nPower theft, especially in rural areas, is rampant, with some communities normalizing it as a cultural practice.\nOne-time settlement schemes, often rolled out for political gain, are backfiring and thus encouraging delayed payments and adding to the financial burden.\nPower engineers are pointing fingers at political interference, manpower shortages, and the use of DISCOMs as a welfare platform for votes. They argue that the system is crippled by a lack of resources and a bureaucratic mentality.\nNow the Yogi government is moving ahead with the privatisation of two most heavily indebted DISCOMs â€” Dakshinanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (DVVNL) and Purvanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PuVVNL).\nThe report also highlights innovative solutions like smart meters, prepaid meters, and underground power lines to curb theft and improve efficiency.\nRead the full ground report by Ankit â€” Whatâ€™s Keeping UP Governmentâ€™s Power Distribution Companies Buried In Debt.\n- Anmol N Jain",
