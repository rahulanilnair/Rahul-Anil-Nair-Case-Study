There are six parties with nine MPs which are unattached and of this, Akali Dal, AIMIM and ASP (Kanshi Ram) with one each MPs have made it clear that they oppose the Bills.</p><p>Four-member YSR Congress, which had earlier supported simultaneous polls, may change its stand to oppose the Bill with party sources indicating that they were reviewing the issue after major regional parties like DMK and Trinamool Congress have come out against the proposed legislation.</p>.One Nation, One Election Bill attempt to deflect attention from BJP’s failures: Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin.<p>The stand of four independent MPs -- Engineer Rashid and Amritpal Singh who are in jail, Sarabjeet Khalsa and Umesbhai Patel -- are not immediately known. There is one vacancy in the 543-member Lok Sabha, where 362 votes are needed for two-third majority when the House is in full strength.</p><p>In Rajya Sabha, the BJP-led NDA has the support of 125 MPs, including six nominated members, while I.N.D.I.A. has 86. YSR Congress has eight, BJD has seven, AIADMK 4, BRS 4 and BSP 1 MPs in the Upper House.</p><p>BJD floor leader Sasmit Patra said they would take a call on the issue when the Bills come to the Rajya Sabha as the party does not have any member in Lok Sabha. Trinamool has 13, DMK and AAP 10 each and SP 4 MPs in Rajya Sabha.</p><p>Senior Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said, “My view is that this entire thing is a folly. In any case, the votes today have demonstrated that the BJP does not have the two-third majority required to pass a constitutional amendment.”</p><p><strong>In Lok Sabha</strong></p><p>Confirmed Votes for Simultaneous Elections:</p><p>NDA: 292 (excluding Speaker)</p><p>Against Simultaneous Elections</p><p>I.N.D.I.A.: 236</p><p>Akali Dal: 1</p><p>ASP (Kanshi Ram): 1</p><p>AIMIM: 1</p><p><strong>TOTAL: 239</strong></p><p><strong>Stand Not Known:</strong></p><p>YSR Congress: 4</p><p>VOTTP: 1</p><p>ZPM: 1</p><p>Ind: 4</p>",
