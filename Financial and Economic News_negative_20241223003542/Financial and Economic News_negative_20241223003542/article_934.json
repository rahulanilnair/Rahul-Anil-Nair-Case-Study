    "text": "After Washington announced fresh curbs on semiconductor exports to China this month, Beijing condemned the move as “malicious” suppression and said it would firmly defend the rights of Chinese businesses.\\nA day later, the Chinese government unveiled its own restrictions on mineral exports to the US including gallium, germanium, antimony and superhard materials, which are used in military and technological production.\\nAnalysts say that swift retaliation – although aimed at measures implemented by the current Joe Biden administration – offers clues as to how China will approach the incoming government led by Donald Trump.\\nSpeculation has been rife about how Beijing will take on Trump in his second presidency, given that the Republican’s first term was marked by a trade war with China and he has repeatedly vowed to slap additional tariffs on Chinese goods.\\nAccording to analysts, China is now more confident about dealing with Trump compared to the first time around, with Beijing expected to be less patient when faced with American tariffs and that it could instead respond with harsher restrictions of its own.\\n\\n\\nRobert Ross, a political science professor at Boston College, said Beijing’s response to the latest US technology restrictions was an effort to convey to the incoming administration that it will retaliate against such moves.\\nAnnouncing its measures, the Chinese commerce ministry said the US had “overextended the concept of national security, abused export control measures [and] unreasonably restricted the export of products to China”.\\nIn a separate move last week, China said it would impose visa restrictions on US personnel who had “behaved poorly” on Hong Kong-related issues. That was in response to threats by Washington to sanction officials responsible for implementing Hong Kong’s national security law.\\n“The Chinese leadership understands that the Biden administration is no longer a significant partner to work with … and it has moved on to dealing with the Trump administration,” Ross said.\\n“Its retaliation against the Biden administration is not relevant to American policy, but it can signal to the Trump administration China’s determination to resist and retaliate – we’ve seen that fairly clearly.”\\nRoss said it appeared that Beijing was waiting to see what Trump’s first moves towards China would be after taking office in January before it hit Washington with any fresh measures.\\n“It has signalled its resistance. It has signalled its determination. Now it’s going to wait and see how Trump will manage China before it does anything new,” he said. “[China] is prepared to retaliate against Trump.”\\nTrump is not expected to tread softly on China, especially after the president-elect recruited a team of people who have previously taken hardline positions on Beijing, such as Marco Rubio as his secretary of state.\\nAccording to Lu Xiang, an expert on US-China relations at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Trump is likely to be still evaluating the use of tariffs against major trading partners including China given the impact it might have on the American economy.\\nBut Lu said tariffs were to Trump “the most beautiful thing … that he can use to solve everything with”.\\nHe said it remained to be seen whether Trump would seek to hammer out an agreement with China or impose sanctions once he took office, but Beijing would be ready either way.\\nFrom China’s perspective, “nothing too terrible” could happen since there had already been some decoupling between the world’s two largest economies in recent years, according to Lu.\\n“I don’t think there is much to worry about now,” he added.\\nWhich Donald Trump shows up? We don’t know\\nRobert Ross, Boston College\\nRoss said Trump might be torn between using sanctions to reach a new agreement with China to boost American exports – as he did during his first term – and imposing tariffs to weaken the Chinese economy.\\n“The bottom line is that there are two Donald Trumps. There’s the Donald Trump that wants to avoid international conflict and wants to avoid escalated tensions … and then there’s the Donald Trump who wants to compete with China and sees China as a challenge to the American economy,” he said.\\n“Which Donald Trump shows up? We don’t know.”\\nRegardless of which way it goes, Chinese academics agreed that Beijing learned a lot from Trump’s first presidency, and this time it was prepared.\\nVictor Gao, vice-president of Beijing-based think tank the Centre for China and Globalisation, said Trump was “unknown” to China when he first took office after winning the 2016 presidential election.\\nHe noted that Beijing “rolled out the red carpet” when Trump visited in 2017 but when he returned to the US, he “almost immediately started the trade war against China, which was highly damaging to China-US trade”.\\nGao said the Chinese system at the time had “scrambled into action and tried to really do a lot of homework as to how to better understand [Trump] as a person, as a politician, and as a businessman”.\\nBut now, China “knows Trump as a person, his character, his peculiarities, and whatever he has declared to the Americans and to the world”. “There is a lot of understanding of Trump in China,” he said.\\n“Trump is no longer an unknown factor. He’s highly unpredictable, of course, and very uncertain. But he’s known to China, to the Chinese government, to the Chinese leaders.”\\nAccording to Gao, that means Beijing would be unlikely to be surprised if Trump attempts to “manhandle” it again, but this time “China will be fully prepared”.\\n\\nHe Weiwen, senior fellow at the Beijing think tank and a former economic and commercial counsellor at the Chinese consulates in San Francisco and New York, said a key lesson China learned from Trump’s first term was how to navigate the trade war.\\nAccording to He, while Trump was likely to push forward with protectionist policies in his second term, Beijing now had “experience” with tariffs and how to deal with them, as well as Trump’s treatment of US allies.\\nHe said Beijing was also aware that there was always room for negotiation with Trump.\\nYun Sun, director of the China programme at the Stimson Centre in Washington, agreed. She said Trump’s threat of imposing 10 per cent additional tariffs on Chinese goods – after earlier threatening up to 60 per cent – was an “invitation to negotiate”.\\n“If China is strategic, it will engage in such negotiations early, and try to bring on the best China can offer in terms of trade package and structural reform,” she said.\\n“The key is to avoid getting into the tit-for-tat cycle. Once you are in retaliation mode, neither leader can back off and things will only stand to escalate. That’s what we had during the first Trump term.”\\nLu from the CASS suggested Beijing would focus on Trump’s actions after his return to the White House – from trade to security to sovereignty issues – and respond accordingly.\\n“As long as the US side is willing to interact, we will interact. But if the US insists on ruining the relationship, we will have no way to change that. It takes two hands to clap,” he said.\\nLu noted that the trade war had continued since Trump’s first term and said he expected China to “certainly increase” its countermeasures if the incoming president doubled down on tariffs.\\nIn dealing with the new Trump administration, He from the CCG said China would need to consider all possibilities “especially the worst” and make plans for them. If Trump sought to “suppress” China, he said the Chinese response should be to “resolutely oppose it”.\\nPointing to Beijing’s retaliation against American semiconductor curbs, He noted that China still had an advantage in key mineral products and that it could seek to further restrict their export.\\n“We dare to fight and we are equally good at fighting,” he said, though he added that Beijing should try to cooperate with Washington on certain issues and work towards stabilising ties.\\n\\n\\nRoss from Boston College said based on its experience in Trump’s first term, Beijing would not be hopeful about the prospects for expanding trade with the US and it would see that tech restrictions were not going away.\\nThat has already prompted measures to boost technology self-reliance, which Ross said made Beijing feel “more confident today that it can resist American pressures”.\\nAt the same time, he said China also believed that compromising with the US would not necessarily lead to an improvement in ties because of the direction of US-China competition, meaning that Beijing would see little incentive to cooperate with American sanctions.\\nRoss expected China to be less patient with Trump’s trade policies – particularly when they involve tariffs – as “it understands that there’s little China can do to reverse American policy”.\\n“China no longer believes it is in its interest to try and cooperate more with the United States because the United States is not interested in reciprocating. American tariffs will remain high, American technology restrictions will continue to grow,” he said.\\n“Compared to the first [Trump] term, the Chinese are much less willing to search for ways to avoid escalation, to avoid trade conflict, and more likely to rely on retaliatory threats to try and persuade the United States to not challenge Chinese interests.”\\nEchoing He’s sentiments, Ross said China would likely continue with its restrictions on rare earths and critical minerals exports, and focus on “vulnerabilities” in the US economy. He also expected China to raise tariffs on American industries that depend on the Chinese market including agriculture.\\nAndrew Scobell, distinguished fellow for China at the US Institute of Peace, said China’s reactive approach – where Beijing acts only when the US imposes measures like sanctions – could be an opportunity for the Trump administration to be strategic.\\nIt would also mean that Trump could “set the tone and agenda for the next four years of US-China relations”.\\nBut Ross was less optimistic. He said Washington’s way of dealing with the China challenge was to seek to constrain its rise and protect the American economy.\\n“This requires policies towards China that restrict China’s economic growth … That’s the long-term trend,” he said.\\n“I don’t think there’s any expectation in the United States that it is in America’s interest to reach an agreement with China or to moderate US-China conflict that will allow China to grow faster or to allow China’s influence to grow either in Asia or anywhere else in the world.”\\n",
