    "text": "District court judge made right decision to protect free markets | Opinion John Wittman | Guest Columnist The Oklahoma state Legislature passed the Energy Discriminations Eliminations Act (EDEA) in 2022, intended to prevent public state funds, including pension assets, from being managed by financial institutions that are deemed to be boycotting certain industries, including energy companies.\nThe law empowered the state treasurer to compile a list of financial companies that boycott energy companies and would then blacklist them from managing any state pension plans due to the alleged boycotts. The reality couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, many of the financial companies the law is intended to target are some of the largest oil and gas industry financers, as evidenced by the Banking on Climate Chaos report released earlier this year. Additionally, traditional energy does not have trouble finding financing and banking services. This begs the question: What exactly is the Oklahoma treasurer using to make these determinations?The law attempts to solve a perceived issue that doesn’t exist while serving as a prime example of egregious government overreach, adding increased administrative and regulatory costs that fall on taxpayers while harming the pensions of retirees in the process. In granting a temporary injunction against enforcement of the law, Oklahoma County District Court Judge Sheila Stinson agreed , stating that “the Court finds that divesture or transfer of assets and investments has the potential to affect the financial soundness of the investment accounts.” The judge made the right decision, and ultimately, the legislation needs to be overturned.\nMore: Opinion: Let's protect Oklahoma's fully funded public pension system\nLast month, Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond reaffirmed his support for the EDEA and appealed the county judge’s ruling to the Oklahoma Supreme Court where it now awaits judgment . The state’s lawmakers show no signs of letting up despite the clear negative consequences on retirees’ pensions.\nOklahoma appears to be taking a page out of the California playbook — just from the opposite side. While California’s law requires large companies to report any climate-related financial risks or face steep penalties, part of the Oklahoma law limits access to certain pension assets that could be profitable. In both cases, each state is injecting unnecessary regulatory burdens into business and financial operations based on partisan politics. While this type of political power grab may work in California, that is not the reputation the Sooner State should be known for.\nLawmakers need to focus on policies that promote free market principles and empower asset managers to invest in opportunities that yield the best results for their pensioners.\nThis is true for any proposed legislation that would insert more government into the free market, and voters support this sentiment. More than 90% of voters agree that state governments should not use taxpayer dollars to push their own political agendas on in the marketplace, according to a recent poll conducted by the National Taxpayers Association. Anytime the government engages in social engineering, whether from the left or the right, the market and taxpayers lose.\n John Wittman of Edmond is the executive director of Americans for Free Markets, a coalition of groups in support of free markets and economic growth\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",
