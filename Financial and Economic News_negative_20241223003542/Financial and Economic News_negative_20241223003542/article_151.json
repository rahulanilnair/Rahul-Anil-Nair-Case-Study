    "text": "OPINION:\nHoly guacamole! Prices may increase further under Trump\nTuesday, Dec. 17, 2024 | 2 a.m.\nView more of the Sun's opinion section\nThe next time you buy an avocado, check the label.\nThere’s a good chance it’s from Mexico, and once Donald Trump is in office, he’ll slap a tariff on those little suckers.\nTrump has threatened to impose a tariff as high as 25% on all Mexican imports, though nothing is certain at this point.\n“At this date, we know little about how the Trump administration will implement new tariffs,” the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization based in Washington, D.C., wrote recently.\n“Fundamental policy designs have yet to be announced, including the tariff rates that will be ultimately applied, if tariffs will be phased in, if any products will be excluded, and whether FTA (free trade agreement) partners will be exempt.”\nDespite the uncertainty, it’s not a bad idea to buy certain items now, before they become even more pricey.\nDo you love Champagne? Stock up! (In 2020, the first Trump administration considered a retaliatory, 100% tariff on Champagne during a trade tiff.)\nCan’t start the day without a cup of freshly ground coffee? Splurge on a few extra bags of beans! (The U.S. is the biggest coffee importer in the world, with most beans coming from Brazil, Colombia and Guatemala.)\nBeen eyeing a pair of leather boots? Buy ’em! (According to the Peterson Institute, 99% of our shoes are imported, which means they will likely cost more in 2025.)\nIn the market for a new TV or game console? Don’t put it off! (Most TVs and many video game consoles are made in China. Trump initially threatened to impose a 60% tariff on Chinese-made imports, though he more recently spoke of a 10% increase, which likely elicited a “muted sigh of relief,” according to the Brookings Institute.)\nWhen it comes to avocados, though, we’re out of luck. Stocking up prior to the inauguration won’t do much good unless you freeze them, and that’s not recommended.\n“Unfortunately, avocado not only loses its smooth, creamy texture, it also loses much of its fresh flavor in the freezer,” according to a 2023 article in “The Pioneer Woman.”\n(It is possible, however, to make guacamole from other types of produce, including green peas and edamame. Keep that in mind when the Super Bowl rolls around.)\nBut wait a minute. Don’t we grow plenty of avocados right here in America?\nIndeed we do.\nBut the supply is not nearly enough; 90% of avocados consumed in the U.S. are imported mostly from Mexico, which may be why some folks have gone bananas over the idea of a tariff.\nIt’s gotten to the point that avocados have become the unofficial poster child for the Trump tariffs.\nHere’s a recent headline from The New York Times: “Prepare for guacamole to be a luxury item.”\nAnother from Newsweek: “Avocado prices set to soar because of Trump tariff.”\nAnd one from PBS: “Trump’s tariff threats jeopardize avocados, tequila and other iconic Mexican products.”\nBut let’s put this in perspective. It’s not like we’ll wind up spending $10 on a single avocado. An avocado that sells for $1 — which, granted, is hard to find right now — will be $1.25 if a 25% tariff kicks in.\nThat’s not so bad, but this isn’t just about avocados. The U.S. also imports tons of other produce grown in Mexico, including tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, lettuce, squash, watermelon and berries.\nThis is about the cumulative effect of tariffs on multiple imports, coupled with the possibility that America could lose most of its farmworkers if Trump makes good on his promise of mass deportations.\nThat will have a direct impact on the food produced right here in the United States.\n“If a farmer cannot get a crop fully harvested due to a labor shortage, whatever crop does get picked will become more valuable and thus more expensive when it finally reaches the grocery store,” wrote Fresno Bee columnist Tad Weber, who lobbied for a bipartisan effort to exempt farmworkers from deportation.\nThat makes sense.\nSo does exempting food from the Trump tariffs.\nWhile we can do without a lot of stuff — in fact, it would be good for the environment to reduce our consumption of just about everything — we cannot live without food, which is already expensive enough.\nTruffles and caviar may be luxury items, but avocados and other fresh produce are not.\nAmericans already eat far too little fresh produce; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 1 in 10 adults gets enough fruits or vegetables. Making those items more costly will only make matters worse.\nFor the sake of public health, let’s hope Trump’s threat of a 25% tariff on Mexican imports was merely a bluff — one that will never withstand the light of day.\nIf not, the pain we all experienced from recent years of high inflation could be just a preview of what’s to come.\nStephanie Finucane is a columnist for The Sacramento Bee.",
