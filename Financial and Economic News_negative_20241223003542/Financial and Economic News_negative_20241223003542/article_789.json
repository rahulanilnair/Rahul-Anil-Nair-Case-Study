Media caption, Angela Rayner said on Monday that she wants the whole of England to have mayors\nMs Brown, leader of the Labour Group, said devolution could put decision making \"closer to local people and should ensure a better approach\".\nShe said: \"This also presents a real opportunity to secure the investment in infrastructure required to support sustainable growth and deliver more affordable homes that Oxford clearly needs...\n\"We have already been engaging in discussions with neighbouring councils in Oxfordshire, Berkshire and elsewhere, about the potential creation of a Thames Valley Mayoral Combined Authority.\n\"Government has also indicated it is seeking to introduce a single tier of local authorities â€“ so-called unitary councils, as part of this process.\"\nShe added the white paper mentioned that unitary authorities would be expected to contain about 500,000 people, which would be too big for Oxford and too small for Oxfordshire, but that decisions would be made on a case-by-case basis.\nShe said the council would be looking at \"the very different needs of a city from its surrounding rural hinterland\".\nImage source, Oxford City Council Image caption, Oxford City Council leader Susan Brown welcomed the proposals\nA Oxfordshire County Council spokesman said it was \"committed to seizing the benefits provided by more investment, powers and influence and to ensure that the proceeds of our economy, now and in the future, are shared more fairly across all of our communities\".\nHe said it would be working closely with local authority partners over the coming weeks to \"collectively discuss its implications\".\n\"This council is still actively planning the delivery of county council elections, together with city and district council colleagues in May 2025,\" he added.\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, The government will announce the parts of the country it is prioritising for devolution \"in due course\"\nConservative leader of the opposition, Eddie Reeves, said he favoured a \"single council that is accountable to residents\".\nHe also said he hoped parties would put \"party politics aside to find the right models, both of devolution and of local government reform, that are in residents' best interests\".\nBut speaking in the House of Commons, Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, said: \"South Oxfordshire District Council has doubled the number of social homes delivered over the last 10 years, meanwhile Oxford City next door has halved it.\n\"So there are districts doing incredible work - why should they face finding themselves lumped in with other underperforming councils?\"\nThe government said the parts of the country it was prioritising for devolution would be revealed in due course, with the aim of holding mayoral elections in those areas in May 2026.\nGet in touch Do you have a story BBC Oxfordshire should cover?\nContact form\nContact form You can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook , external , X (Twitter) , external , or Instagram , external .\nRelated topics UK devolution Oxford",
