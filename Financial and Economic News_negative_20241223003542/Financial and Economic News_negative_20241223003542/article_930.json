    "text": "Germany's auto giants, such as Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, are going through a very turbulent time. Now Trump wants to turn them into American companies\nThe promise of the president-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, to impose tariffs on imported goods puts Germany's automotive sector at risk, affecting Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.\nThe industry, which is already facing economic difficulties, could see its exports drastically impacted by the new tariffs.\nDuring the election campaign, Trump made clear his intention to transform German automakers into American companies.I want German car companies to become American companies. I want them to build their factories here.”, declared the then-candidate in Savannah, Georgia.\n-\n[China impresses the world with the Tianyan-504, the most powerful quantum computer ever created, which masters 504 qubits and promises to transform technology like never before!](https://en.clickpetroleoegas.com.br/China-impresses-the-world-with-the-Tianyan-504%2C-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-ever-created%2C-which-masters-504-qubits-and-promises-to-transform-technology-like-never-before/)\n-\n[China installs and tests advanced high-efficiency steam generator](https://en.clickpetroleoegas.com.br/China-has-installed-and-tested-an-advanced-high-efficiency-steam-generator/)\n-\n[Scientists Make Staggering Estimate: There May Be 6 Billion Earth-Like Planets in Our Galaxy Alone](https://en.clickpetroleoegas.com.br/Scientists-make-a-staggering-estimate-that-there-may-be-6-billion-Earth-like-planets-in-our-galaxy-alone/)\n-\n[Trillions of tons of hydrogen could power Earth for over 1.000 years](https://en.clickpetroleoegas.com.br/trillions-of-tons-of-hydrogen-could-supply-the-earth-for-over-1-years/)\nThe planned tariffs are not limited to Europe. Trump announced in his first measures a 10% tariff on Chinese goods and 25% on goods imported from Canada and Mexico.\nAlthough Europe has not yet been mentioned, experts believe it is only a matter of time before the European automotive sector is targeted.\nThe German automotive crisis – Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz\nGermany is Europe's largest exporter of cars to the United States. In 2023, the country exported around 23 billion euros (approximately 24,2 billion dollars) in vehicles to the US, representing 15% of total German exports to the American market, according to Eurostat and ING Research.\nThe main manufacturers, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, are already facing an unfavorable economic situation.\nThe companies issued alerts profits, citing weakened demand in China, the world's largest auto market.\nRico Luman, a senior economist at Dutch bank ING, believes the situation could get worse with Trump's tariffs.\nAccording to him, the entire production chain would be threatened: “The automotive industry is linked to the steel industry and the chemical industry. The entire supply chain would be involved.”, he stated to\n[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/17/vw-bmw-and-mbg-german-auto-giants-brace-for-trumps-tariff-threats.html).\nResponse from car manufacturers Trump's speech\nVolkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz are trying to overcome the unfavorable scenario. A Volkswagen spokesperson highlighted that more than 90% of the vehicles sold by the company\n[brand ](https://en.clickpetroleoegas.com.br/China-has-installed-and-tested-an-advanced-high-efficiency-steam-generator/)in the USA are produced in North America, taking advantage of the United States, Canada, Mexico Free Trade Agreement (USMCA).\nHowever, the tariffs of Trump over Canada and Mexico would put the USMCA in check, nullifying the current tax benefits.\nMercedes-Benz also defended its presence in the US. The German automaker claims to employ more than 11 people in the country, with production concentrated on passenger cars and vans. In a statement, it said it is awaiting a “constructive dialogue with the new administration\".\nA BMW, which has the brand's largest production facility in Spartanburg, South Carolina, declined to comment directly on the tariff threats.\nThe Spartanburg plant is strategic, with the capacity to produce around 450 vehicles per year.\nDespite the efforts, the results in the financial market already reflect the difficulties.\nThe actions of Volkswagen e BMW fell around 23% year-to-date, while the Group Mercedes-Benz registered a drop of 13%.\nThe weight of tariffs\nMichael Robinet of automotive consultancy S&P Global Mobility believes Trump's rhetoric can translate into concrete action.It may not be exactly as promised during the campaign, but some pressure will come, whether through tariffs or other unilateral measures.\".\nRobinet also raises a critical issue: unemployment levels in the US. With the unemployment rate hovering around 4%, he questions the ability to create more jobs in the US auto sector, as promised by Trump.\nSeparately from the tariffs on Canada, Mexico e China, Trump has also suggested a blanket tariff of 10% to 20% on all goods imported into the US. It is not yet clear whether this proposal will become official policy, but the risk is there.\nJulia Poliscanova, senior director of the Transport and Environment group, warns that Europe needs to prepare. “Trump Wants More Tariffs, So Everyone Needs to Be Ready”, she said in an interview. For her, the impact will be negative in the short term, but it also represents an opportunity.\n\"Europe needs to stay the course, accelerating electrification and investing in clean technologies. If Trump focuses solely on protectionism, the US could be left behind”, Poliscanova added.\nThe impact on the global economy\nTrump's tariffs come at a delicate time for the global economy. The auto sector, especially in Europe, is already facing pressure from the transition to electric vehicles and falling demand from China.\nIn Germany, the automotive industry represents around 5% of GDP and directly employs more than 800 people. Any significant decline in the sector would have a cascading effect across the entire German economy.\nThe impact would also extend to component suppliers. Companies linked to the chemical, metallurgical and technology industries depend on automakers to maintain their operations. A 25% tariff could make exports unviable, forcing automakers to review their global strategies.\nThe next steps\nFaced with uncertainty, German automakers are trying to expand their production in the US. Investing in local factories is a way to avoid tariffs and remain competitive. However, the costs involved are high and the return may take a long time.\nAnalysts point out that Trump's protectionist stance could also trigger trade retaliation from the European Union. This would lead to a trade war, harming both sides.\nFor now, the German automotive industry is on alert. Between weak demand in China, potential tariffs in the US and the challenge of the electric transition, carmakers are facing one of the most complex moments in their history.\n[](#fdnw-reactions)",
