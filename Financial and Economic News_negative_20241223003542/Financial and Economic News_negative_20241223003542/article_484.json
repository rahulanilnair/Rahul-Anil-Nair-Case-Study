The letter said many of their members are now destitute and have had their dignity taken away as result of failure to get reimbursed through the so-called Global Compensation Deal.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Under an accord signed in 2020, the government agreed to compensate about 4,000 White farmers whose land was seized by state-backed militants, but it has repeatedly missed payment deadlines. The government expects the deal to cost $3.5 billion over as many as 10 years.\nThe Harare-based government has defended the land seizures, saying they were meant to address colonial imbalances.\n“The current approach risks eroding trust and undermining the structured dialogue platform’s objectives,” the unions said in the letter seen seen by Bloomberg and confirmed by the finance ministry. “We urge your ministry to prioritize dialogue with the GCD signatories to develop a cohesive, homegrown solution that balance compensation with agricultural recovery.”\nSo far 1,300 former white commercial farmers have signed up to receive compensation, according to official data.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Zimbabwe set aside $35 million in the budget for the year that ended March 31 to begin payments. It set aside $10 million for the current fiscal year.\nThe country has identified at least 439 former land owners as beneficiaries for the financial settlement of $331 million, according to the African Development Bank.\nThe government will continue to make payments to farmers who want to be compensated, said Andrew Bvumbe, the head of debt management in the finance ministry.\n--With assistance from Desmond Kumbuka.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDesperate Nursing Students Turn to Fixers for Their Clinical Training\nHow Can the World Move Beyond Combustion Cars?
