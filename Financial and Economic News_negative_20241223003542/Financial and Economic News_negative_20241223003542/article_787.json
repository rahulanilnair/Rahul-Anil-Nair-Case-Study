It is also the latest twist in a long-running saga over the privatisation of army homes.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Some 55,000 properties were sold to Annington for £1.7bn and then leased back by the MoD under a 1996 deal struck under John Major’s government.\nHowever, the privatisation deal has since been dogged by controversy, with the National Audit Office (NAO) concluding the taxpayers lost more than £4bn on the sale.\nThe spending watchdog said the MoD had dramatically underestimated how much the value of the homes would rise by. The estate is now worth £10bn, according to the MoD.\nMeanwhile, the Government has also been saddled with huge costs for both rent and maintenance for which it retained responsibility.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Meg Hillier, the then-chairman of the Commons parliamentary affairs committee, called the sale a “rotten deal for the taxpayer” at the time of the NAO report in 2018.\nThe MoD originally argued in the 1990s that taking out a 200-year lease would free up money to spend on improvements. However, it now says owning the homes outright will be cheaper in the long run and will save the Government some £230m a year in rent.\nOn Tuesday, John Healey, the Defence Secretary, said the new deal presented a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to fix up the military housing estate and create jobs.\nDefence Secretary John Healey says the new deal presents an opportunity to fix up the military housing estate - Jason Alden/Pool/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Richard Hands, the managing director of Terra Firma, said: “This deal ensures long-term value for both parties and brings an end to the legal disputes which had created uncertainty for both Annington and UK service families.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in World Hundreds of thousands of bodies could be buried in Syrian mass graves, advocacy group says CNN Who Killed [Spoiler] on General Hospital? Sonny or Cyrus? COMINGSOON.net Decades-Submerged Corvette Rescued from Oregon River Backfire News 'The greatest American battle': See photos from WWII's Battle of the Bulge 80 years on USA TODAY “This resolution also enables Annington to focus on exciting future growth prospects in the UK’s residential property market.”\nThe transaction draws a line under a legal battle between the Government and Mr Hands over the properties.\nMr Hands’ Annington Homes filed a legal claim against the Housing Secretary with the European Court of Human Rights in September. The billionaire was challenging the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act, which gives leaseholders the right to buy the freehold of the property.\nMr Hands feared that the law could open a loophole that would harm its ownership and allow the MoD to buy back the homes on the cheap.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement There is also a separate legal dispute between Annington Homes and the MoD over who has the rights to the properties.\nAnnington, which was previously owned by a consortium led by Japanese bank Nomura, was bought for £3.2bn in 2012 by Terra Firma, Mr Hands’ private equity firm.\nMr Healey said savings unlocked by the deal would be used to plough cash into improving the estate.\nAccording to the MoD, the deal means the Government no longer has to plan for £4.3bn of liabilities related to the previous arrangement with Annington, unlocking “headroom” in budgets for spending on “substantive redevelopment and improvements”.\nAdvertisement Advertisement For example, in the coming days, officials will submit a planning application for 265 new houses and apartments for personnel at RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire.\nSeparate plans will also be submitted in the spring for some 300 new houses at Catterick Garrison, in North Yorkshire.\nThe MoD pointed to Imjin Barracks, in Gloucestershire, as an example of what could be delivered in future. There, it is in the process of building 176 homes equipped with low-carbon heating systems and solar panels that will help to reduce energy bills for military families.\nImproving the military estate is viewed as a key priority by service chiefs, as they struggle to recruit enough people and face complaints about the state of accommodation on some bases.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the chief of the defence staff, said: “We understand the importance placed on this for people’s morale and decisions on whether to continue in the Armed Forces long term.\n“This work will provide military families the higher-quality houses they fully deserve. It is very significant and very welcome.”\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.
