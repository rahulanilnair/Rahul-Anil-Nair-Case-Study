    "text": "By Matthew Fazelpoor ,\n1 days ago\nThe basics:\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul revived the controversial congestion pricing plan in November, which will cost vehicles $9 to enter Manhattan's Central Business District south of 60th Street.\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and other state leaders vehemently oppose the plan and vow to keep up the fight against it.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump also expressed opposition to the proposal, raising the question of how the incoming administration will handle the situation.\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul in November resuscitated that state’s controversial congestion pricing plan reigniting a battle that had been dormant for months.\nIn June, just weeks before the toll on vehicles traveling south of 60th Street in Manhattan was set to begin Hochul announced an indefinite pause . The prevailing wisdom was that the delay was a result of the political landscape, with Democrats facing increasing headwinds and affordability issues at the top of the electorate’s minds.\nBut a little more than a week after that election which was won by President-elect Donald Trump along with a Republican trifecta at the federal level Hochul announced Nov. 14 that congestion pricing would move forward, albeit at a reduced rate from the original plan.\nInstead of a $15 peak rate for cars, the revised plan calls for a $9 toll with Hochul framing it as 40% reduction.\n“As I said from the start, a $15 toll was just too high in this economic climate. That’s why our plan cuts the daytime toll to $9 for cars,” said Hochul Nov. 14. “By getting congestion pricing underway and fully supporting the MTA capital plan, we’ll unclog our streets, reduce pollution and deliver better public transit for millions of New Yorkers”\n“New Yorkers deserve cleaner air, safer streets and ambulances that can get to them without gridlock, and the Governor is stepping up for them and for riders who need trains and buses to get them where they have to go just like she did with the Budget in 2023,” said Janno Lieber, CEO of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority . “Now you’re seeing it again, a huge milestone for 6.5 million commuters. We want to bring more frequent and reliable service to all our customers just like we have on the 7 and L lines where upgrades are already complete.”\nCost breakdown\nUnder the plan, daytime E-ZPass tolls will be set at the following levels: Passenger vehicles (once per day): $9; motorcycles (once per day): $4.50; small trucks and non-commuter buses: $14.40; large trucks and sightseeing buses: $21.60.\nIn addition, per ride fees for all trips to, from or within the central business district will be 75 cents for taxis and black cars and $1.50 for app-based for-hire vehicles.\nOn Nov. 14, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced the congestion pricing plan would move forward. The proposal sets the daytime toll at $9 for automobiles to enter the Central Business District, south of 60th Street in Manhattan. - DEPOSIT PHOTOS\nTunnel crossing credits were reduced by 40% from original plan. And nighttime discounts will be 75% daytime tolls.\nBut the “reduced” rate is not permanent. The plan calls for a six-year phase-in, meaning the automobile rate will be $9 at peak times from 2025 through 2027; $12 from 2028 through 2030; and finally hit the originally planned $15 toll in 2031.\nNJ keeping up the fight\nNot surprisingly, the reaction across the river in New Jersey was swift and negative.\n“All of us need to listen to the message that voters across America sent [in the election], which is that the vast majority of Americans are experiencing severe economic strains and still feeling the effects of inflation,” said Gov. Phil Murphy. “There could not be a worse time to impose a new $9 toll on individuals who are traveling into downtown Manhattan for work, school, or leisure.”\nMurphy stressed that the Garden State has never been meaningfully consulted on the design of this plan in either iteration.\n“Perhaps that is because this effort has always simply been a way to take money from the pockets of New Jersey residents to bail out the MTA from a mountain of debt,” said Murphy. “I have consistently expressed openness to a form of congestion pricing that meaningfully protects the environment and does not put unfair burdens upon hardworking New Jersey commuters. Today’s plan woefully fails that test. I urge Gov. Hochul to reconsider the plan.”\n“In a time of inflation, New York’s attempt to whack Jersey families with another tax is utterly absurd,” said U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer , D-5th District, a longtime congestion pricing critic and 2025 gubernatorial candidate . “I’ll be damned if I am going to let the MTA balance their mismanaged, out-of-control budget at the expense of Jersey taxpayers. I’m ready to fight the Congestion Tax again to protect Jersey families from more taxes and more pollution. We stopped the Congestion Tax once and we’ll stop it again. Game on.”\n“Gov. Hochul’s congestion pricing scheme is an ill-thought-out plan to fund the MTA on the backs of New Jerseyans,” said U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill , D-11th District, another outspoken critic and 2025 gubernatorial candidate . \"Gov. Hochul is sending a clear message to New Jerseyans who are essential to New York’s prosperity: You are simply a meal ticket for the MTA.”\nNew Jersey leaders are also pressing on with litigation to block the implementation.\nHitting the gas\nDespite that near universal backlash from the Garden State and other disaffected boroughs and stakeholders, New York officials were undeterred, and things have moved quickly since that Nov. 14 announcement.\nA little more than a week later, the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration quickly approved the new plan, which is set to start Jan. 5, 2025. “FHWA concludes that the Re-Evaluation 2 confirms that the phase-in of the adopted toll structure and impacts associated with it was analyzed and mitigated accordingly,” the FHWA wrote to the project sponsors the MTA, New York State Department of Transportation and the New York City Department of Transportation. “Thus, FHWA finds that no additional environmental analysis is warranted. The conclusions in the Final Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact remains valid.”\nOn Nov. 14, 2024, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced a plan to begin implementing congestion pricing in New York City by early January. - PROVIDED BY DON POLLARD/OFFICE OF GOV. HOCHUL\n“We are pleased to have received formal approval from the Federal Highway Administration for the phase-in feature of the Central Business District Tolling Program, and in compliance with federal law and regulations, New York State DOT, New York City DOT, TBTA, and the federal government have all signed the Value Pricing Pilot Program Agreement,” said MTA Bridges and Tunnels/Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority President Catherine Sheridan in a Nov. 22 statement.\nMurphy pledged that the state would continue to fight. Attorney Randy Mastro is leading the state’s legal efforts .\n“Despite today’s action by the U.S. Department of Transportation, New Jersey’s fight against congestion pricing will continue,” said Murphy Nov. 22. “We stand resolutely against a tolling scheme that will unfairly burden our commuters. Since the inception of this plan, New York and Washington have not engaged New Jersey in any meaningful way. We will continue to do everything we can to fight this unfair and unpopular plan in the courts. The governor spoke further about this issue on the Nov. 26 edition of his News 12 New Jersey call-in show hosted by Eric Landskroner.\n“We have a question here from Jay and Jay emailed us and said, ‘if you are serious about fighting New York City’s congestion pricing plan, why not veto the minutes of the New York and New Jersey Port Authority to send a message to the elected officials in New York City and New York State that you are serious about halting this congestion pricing that would clearly send this message,’” said Landkroner, presenting a question from the audience. “To his point, that’s something that congressman and gubernatorial candidate Josh Gottheimer has spoken about also. You’ve referred to it as the nuclear option.”\n“That’s got to be on the table as an option,” said Murphy. “There was a hearing with the federal judge today. And the judge, to his credit, and I don’t want to be true to this has asked both sides to not comment on what happened inside the courtroom today. But Jay, that’s got to be on the table. Let’s see where the judge lands.”\nMurphy stressed that he is against pollution and wants to mitigate it as much as anyone but said that this congestion pricing plan is problematic in several ways.\n“One, it’ll displace pollution from New York City to northern Jersey. Secondly, it will be a tax as you rightfully pointed out,” Murphy continued. “We’re supposed to be made to feel good that it’s only $9 as opposed to the original $15 come on. And then, thirdly, we’re getting none of the proceeds. So, the MTA has basically ridden their fiscal boat on the rocks. This is why they are doing it. And they, in fact, admit it that’s the bigger reason as opposed to mitigating pollution.”\nNot taking 'money from our neighbors'\nHe noted that the MTA faces the same challenges that all big transit systems facing coming out of the pandemic but highlighted a difference in New Jersey’s approach to NJ Transit (albeit one that led to a major backlash from the business community with the corporate transit fee ).\n“We have chosen to solve NJ Transit’s issues within the four walls of New Jersey. Not without pain by the way,” said Murphy. “But we are going to do it by ourselves. We are not going to go over and take money from our neighbors. And that’s what this is. So, we’ll see where the judge lands. I’m hoping he’ll come up with a decision sooner than later but to Jay’s point, we keep all options on the table.”\n[box type=\"shadow\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"40%\" ]\nDEPOSIT PHOTOS\nDon't miss this:\nIn anticipation of a new president taking office, BridgeTower Media spoke with experts across several industries to explore what the incoming Trump administration might mean for them. Read what they're predicting >>\n[/box]\nThe federal suit brought in New Jersey is one of several by different groups, townships and counties attempting to thwart congestion pricing. A hearing in Manhattan federal court is slated for Dec. 20 stemming from a suit brought by New York stakeholders opposed to congestion.\nAs all of these different actions play out, the clock is ticking fast with just under a month until congestion pricing is set to launch.\nAnd then of course, there is the question about how the incoming Trump administration will handle the situation.\nIn a Nov. 14 social media post, Trump expressed his opposition to congestion pricing.\n“I have great respect for the Governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, and look forward to working with her to Make New York and America Great Again,” said Trump. “But I strongly disagree with the decision on the congestion tax. It has never worked, but especially so with a city, town, or village that is trying to come back from very rough times, which can certainly be said of New York city. It will put New York City at a disadvantage over competing cities and states, and businesses will flee.” Copyright &copy; 2024 BridgeTower Media.
