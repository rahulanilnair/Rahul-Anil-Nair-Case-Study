    "text": "In the high-stakes world of business travel, timing is everything. One of the most nerve-wracking decisions for frequent flyers is whether to book a seat in advance or play the waiting game, hoping for a better deal. This strategy, often referred to as “playing chicken” with flight bookings, can be a risky yet potentially rewarding endeavour. See our article on buying seats at check in as well!\nThe Gamble Booking a flight can be a delicate balance between securing a seat and getting the best price. Airlines often release a limited number of seats at lower prices, which can quickly sell out. As the departure date approaches, prices typically rise, reflecting the increased demand. However, there are instances where airlines drop prices at the last minute to fill unsold seats. This creates a tantalising opportunity for savvy travellers willing to take the risk.\nThe Pros For business travellers with flexible schedules, waiting to book a flight can lead to significant savings. Airlines sometimes offer last-minute deals to avoid flying with empty seats, which can result in substantial discounts. Additionally, the advent of fare prediction tools and apps has made it easier to gauge the best time to book, providing a semblance of control over the unpredictable nature of flight pricing.\nThe Cons On the flip side, the strategy is fraught with potential pitfalls. The most obvious risk is that prices may not drop, leaving travellers to pay a premium for their procrastination. In the worst-case scenario, flights may sell out entirely, forcing a change in travel plans or the need to book a less convenient or more expensive alternative. For business travellers with tight schedules and important meetings, this uncertainty can be a significant drawback.\nSo what do we need to know? Know Your Route: Some routes are more predictable in terms of pricing trends. Frequent travellers on these routes can develop a sense of when to book.\nUse Fare Prediction Tools: Apps like Sky scanner and Google Flights can provide insights into the best times to book, helping to mitigate some of the risks.\nSet Alerts: Many travel websites offer price alerts that notify you when fares drop for your desired route.\nBe Flexible: Flexibility with travel dates and times can increase your chances of snagging a last-minute deal.\nHave a Backup Plan: Always have an alternative plan in case your gamble doesn’t pay off. This could mean being prepared to pay a higher fare or considering alternative routes and airlines.\nPlaying chicken is not for the faint-hearted. It requires a keen understanding of airline pricing strategies, a flexible schedule, and a willingness to accept the risks involved. For those who master the art, the rewards can be substantial, making it a viable strategy for the seasoned business traveller. However, for those with less flexibility or a lower tolerance for risk, booking in advance remains the safest and probably most expensive bet.",
