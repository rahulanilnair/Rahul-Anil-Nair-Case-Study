Maybe other similar tax bills can be created in the future.\nIf someone has three acres of land with one house on part of it, then fine them for unoccupied acres until people can put in designer trailer homes or tents. If someone has an unused car that they don’t drive or sleep in, then tax the owner until someone lives in it. If someone has an extra house boat, shipping container, abandoned bus or illegal beach-front grass shack that nobody lives in, then fine them until they rent out the extra dwelling.\nIf someone has more of something, then should they be encouraged to enjoy less or be fined until they share with strangers?\nJohn Burns\nWahiawa\nDon't miss out on what's happening!
