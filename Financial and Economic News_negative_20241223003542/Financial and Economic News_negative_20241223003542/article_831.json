    "text": "Deutsche Bank announced on Tuesday that it had downgraded its recommendation on Vivendi shares to 'hold', from 'buy', with the target price unchanged at 2.90 euros.\nIn a research note, the analyst refers to a 'key moment' in the history of the media and entertainment group, with yesterday's initial public offerings of Canal+, Havas and Louis Hachette Group.\nVivendi's share price now reflects the company's new structure: a holding company with post-divestment assets, i.e. a set of interests in listed companies and still-consolidated video games activities\", explains the intermediary.\nDeutsche Bank points out that the demerger, which was intended to eliminate the conglomerate discount that the stock was carrying, created a valuation of around 600 million euros, or 7% of the group's market capitalization.\n'This is less than we anticipated, with the market assigning a larger discount than we expected, no doubt due to concerns about corporate governance', DB continues.\nNow that the deconsolidation scenario - which was the mainstay of its buy recommendation - has passed, the professional has accordingly lowered its recommendation on the stock.\nCopyright (c) 2024 CercleFinance.com.
