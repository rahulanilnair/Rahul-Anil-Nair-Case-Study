    "text": "Feds Say: Louisiana Residents Remove this From Your Wallet Now\nUsually, when there is an edict from the federal government directed at citizens of Louisiana it doesn't go over too well. Here in Louisiana, we have developed [a \"healthy mistrust\" of government ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/red-states-depend-distrust-government)on the federal level. It probably has a lot to do with the way the Feds interact or try and distract our ability to drill for oil and gas. And while we are used to the federal government wanting to dig into our wallets for cash, this is something that is totally different.\nThink of all the items that you currently carry in your physical wallet. Not your digital wallet, which has its own unique set of security concerns. We are talking about the wallet that rides in a [man's back pocket causing him countless hours of back pain ](https://acc.vn/en/gentlemen-keeping-wallet-back-pocket-cool-thing/#:~:text=But%20even%20though%20most%20men,rest%20of%20the%20upper%20body.)or the wallet that rides in a woman's purse that adds weight to her bag making her shoulders feel uncomfortable.\nMost of us have some cash in our wallets. I am sure there are more than a few of us that have a credit card or two. You probably have a three-mile-long receipt from a drugstore and maybe you have some other important Post-It notes or scraps of paper with telephone numbers on them. You might have one or two business cards as well. Believe it or not, all of these items are just fine for you to carry around according to the federal government.\nWhat's the One Thing You Should Never Carry in Your Wallet?\nOddly enough, the one item the federal government urges you to not carry around with you is the one document the Feds use to determine who you are. Have you figured it out? The federal government and specifically the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/number-card) is urging you to [Guard Your Card](https://www.ssa.gov/number-card) by not carrying it around with you.\nFirst things first, why does our government make such an important document like our Social Security Card out of paper? Shouldn't that be at least laminated like a driver's license? Second, [what's the reasoning behind not having your card with you?](https://www.al.com/news/2023/10/worst-thing-to-keep-in-your-wallet-according-to-federal-officials.html)\nScammers. Quite simply[ scammers are the reason](https://blog.ssa.gov/social-security-cards-are-safer-at-home/#:~:text=Scams%20to%20steal%20your%20personal,is%20not%20an%20identification%20document.) you don't want your card number available online and you certainly don't want a scammer to get a hold of your physical card. Remember, a [Social Security Card](https://www.ssa.gov/) is not an identification document. Only one state, Pennsylvania requires a card when [applying for RealID](https://www.expresslane.org/drivers/personal-driver-s-licenses/real-id/) all other states just a number and a corroborating form of identification will work.\n[The fact is this.](https://blog.ssa.gov/social-security-cards-are-safer-at-home/#:~:text=Scams%20to%20steal%20your%20personal,is%20not%20an%20identification%20document.) There are very few reasons you would need to show your physical card in person. The IRS doesn't even require an actual card, they just need to know the number. This should suggest to you just how important safeguarding your Social Security number should be. But the bottom line is this. If you have the actual physical card in your wallet you should take it out and put it in a safe place with your important documents.\nOne-Hit Wonders of the 2000s\nGallery Credit: Taneasha White-Gibson",
