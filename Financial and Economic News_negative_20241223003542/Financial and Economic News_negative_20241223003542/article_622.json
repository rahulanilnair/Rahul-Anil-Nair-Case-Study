    "text": "Brazil’s central bank said inflation risks are materializing due to factors including a weaker currency and resilient demand, forcing the board to signal unanimously that borrowing costs will rise past 14% by March. “Upside inflation risks, such as the resilience of services inflation, the deanchoring of expectations, and exchange rate depreciation, have materialized,” central bankers wrote in minutes to their Dec. 10-11 meeting, when they raised the benchmark Selic by a full percentage point to 12.25%. Several consumer price measures have deteriorated, making the convergence of inflation to the bank’s 3% target more challenging, they wrote. This “less uncertain and more adverse” scenario “required a more timely policy action to maintain the firm commitment to converging inflation to the target,” they wrote in the document published on Tuesday. The committee “unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 1.00 p.p. and to announce that, if the expected scenario confirms, it anticipates an adjustment of the same magnitude at the next two meetings.” Policymakers led by Roberto Campos Neto have pledged two more hikes of the same size as annual inflation accelerates above both the 3% target and 4.5% tolerance range ceiling, with core measures also picking up. Economic activity has remained resilient, driven by stronger household consumption that’s getting a boost from record low unemployment and higher government spending. In that context, traders are even pricing in odds that the next borrowing cost increase in January will be larger than one percentage point. In the minutes, central bankers lifted to 5% their estimate for the neutral rate, which neither restricts nor stimulates the economy. The board also pledged to monitor “more closely” how both a weaker real and the recent worsening of investors’ expectations are transmitted to consumer prices. Investors were dismayed by a plan to cut 70 billion reais ($11.5 billion) in spending over the next two years after the government made the announcement together with tax breaks for poorer families. They have sold local assets such as the real, which has weakened roughly 20% this year and ranks as the worst performing major currency despite central bank intervention. Meanwhile, Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva reinforced his criticism of high rates on Sunday after an almost one-week stay at the hospital following brain surgery. “No one” has more fiscal responsibility than he does, Lula said in an effort to soothe market concerns about his push to keep the economy strong. ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",
