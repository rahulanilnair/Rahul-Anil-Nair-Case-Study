    "text": "Shares of technology companies gave back some of their recent gains following a torrid run to records.\nBitcoin topped $100,000 for the first time, rewarding longtime believers who had often touted the likelihood the cryptocurrency would reach the round number through a decade of wrenching volatility.\nShares of software firm MicroStrategy, which has been buying bitcoin hand over fist for its corporate treasury, fell as the currency's rally stalled out around the $100,000 level. MicroStrategy fell about 5% but remains up by almost 70% in the last month.\nTesla shares rallied after an engineer reportedly said the cyber-taxi -- a self-driving vehicle due to launch in 2026 -- would feature about half the parts of a Model 3, meaning it would be cheap to produce.\nShares of SentinelOne were trading sharply lower after the cybersecurity company reported higher quarterly revenue and a surge in operating expenses.\nWrite to Rob Curran at rob.curran@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n12-09-24 1745ET\nShare Â© Dow Jones - 2024",
