    "text": "[News](../)\nMicroStrategy gives back earlier gains following bitcoin proxy’s inclusion in Nasdaq-100 index and ‘QQQ’ ETF\nMichael Saylor, chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy, speaks during the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami on April 7, 2022.\nEva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nShares of [MicroStrategy](//www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSTR/) were higher Monday after Nasdaq [announced the bitcoin proxy will join the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index](//www.cnbc.com/2024/12/13/bitcoin-proxy-microstrategy-to-join-the-nasdaq-100-and-heavily-traded-qqq-etf.html).\nThe stock was last lower by less than 1%, after jumping as much as 7% earlier.\nNasdaq rebalances its [Nasdaq-100](//www.cnbc.com/quotes/.NDX/) index every year. The companies flagged for inclusion are mostly based on the market cap rankings as of the final trading day of November. The stocks also need to meet a liquidity requirement and have a certain number of free floating shares.\nThe index inclusion, which takes effect Dec. 23, comes after MicroStrategy’s massive surge this year. In 2024, the stock is up 547%, far outpacing the [S&P 500’s](//www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) 26.9% advance, as the price of bitcoin scales to all-time highs. Bitcoin last traded around $105,900.66, up 2.6% on the day.\nMSTR year to date\nThe addition also means MicroStrategy will be included in the popular [Invesco QQQ Trust ETF](//www.cnbc.com/quotes/QQQ/), which tracks the Nasdaq-100. This will likely lead to passive inflows for MicroStrategy stock, potentially giving it another boost.\nMichael Saylor, the company’s founder and chairman, also announced on social media site X on Monday morning that MicroStrategy has bought an additional 15,350 BTC for about $1.5 billion, or roughly $100,386 per coin. It now holds 439,000 bitcoin.\nMicroStrategy has been building its bitcoin reserves for years, making it a proxy for the digital currency.\n“MSTR’s Bitcoin buying program is unprecedented on street, and makes it the largest corporate owner of Bitcoin (2% of supply equivalent to $44Bn market value),” Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani wrote Monday. “Inclusion in Nasdaq100 further improves MSTR’s market liquidity, further expanding its capital flywheel and Bitcoin buying program.”\nSubscribe [to CNBC PRO](//www.cnbc.com/application/pro/) for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.\n[World News](/)||\n[Latest News](/news)||\n[U.S. News](../us-news)\n[Source link](//www.cnbc.com/2024/12/16/microstrategy-shares-jump-as-bitcoin-proxy-will-join-nasdaq-100-index-and-qqq-etf.html)",
