    "text": "At least one presidential inauguration planned for January will not be occurring. Devin Stephenson , who began work in July as president of Florida Polytechnic University , has decided that he does not need an official inauguration ceremony. The Lakeland school had been planning a ceremony for late January, but Stephenson has nixed those plans, directing more than $100,000 budgeted for the event to student scholarships. “I am deeply committed to ensuring that the resources entrusted to us are used to directly benefit those we serve ― our students,” Stephenson wrote in a letter to the university community. “Prioritizing their futures is at the heart of everything I do, always making sure we provide them with the tools and opportunities they need to thrive.” Universities typically hold inaugural ceremonies for new presidents. Florida Poly had made tentative plans for a gathering in the Barnett Applied Research Center in late January, spokesperson Lydia Guzman said. The expected cost of more than $100,000 would have come from the school’s performance-based funding revenue, Guzman said. The ceremony would have drawn some auxiliary funding, based on the details of the required spending, she said. Florida Poly received about $5.8 million in performance-based funds from the state for the 2024-25 fiscal year. Stephenson succeeded Randy K. Avent , Florida Poly’s inaugural president. Avent retired in July after 10 years of leading Florida’s newest university. “I understand the significance of this occasion and the tradition it represents, but I also believe in setting an example of stewardship and accountability,” Stephenson said in the statement. “Fiscal responsibility is a cornerstone of effective leadership, and I am dedicated to making sure every dollar Florida Poly receives is invested in ways that advance our mission.” Stephenson came to Florida Poly from Northwest Florida State College in Niceville, where he spent seven years as president. In that position, he redirected money intended for an investiture event toward student support, Florida Poly said in a news release. “I fully respect and support Dr. Stephenson’s decision, as it reflects his values and commitment to our University’s mission,” Beth Kigel, chair of Florida Poly’s board of trustees, said in the release. “As chair, I share his passion for seeing all our students thrive, and I believe that his focus on their well-being will guide us toward continued success.” Gary White can be reached at [gary.white@theledger.com](mailto:gary.white@theledger.com) or 863-802-7518.
