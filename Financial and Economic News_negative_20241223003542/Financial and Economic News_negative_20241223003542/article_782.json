    "text": "Updated: Dec. 17, 2024, 8:31 a.m. | Published: Dec. 17, 2024, 8:00 a.m.\nStarting next month, drivers will be charged a fee when entering certain parts of Manhattan. (Staten Island Advance/Steve Zaffarano) Staff-Shot\nBy Mike Matteo | mmatteo@siadvance.com STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- There’s been a lot of confusion around congestion pricing these last few months, with a delayed start and new price structure only compounding the issue.\nOriginally, before the plan was put on pause in June , most passenger vehicles would’ve been paying $15 to enter the surface streets in the Congestion Relief Zone (CRZ).\nWhen the controversial tolling plan was resurrected in November , Governor Kathy Hochul pushed for a 40% reduction in tolls from what was planned earlier this year.\nAccording to the governor, the 40% lower fee will still allow the MTA to secure the bonds for capital projects, while saving daily commuters around $1,500 annually.\nDrivers entering the CRZ will be paying a fee that varies depending on vehicle type and time of day.\nDuring the daytime, defined as 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends, drivers with E-ZPass will pay the following:\nPassenger vehicles (once per day): $9 Motorcycles (once per day): $4.50 Small trucks and non-commuter buses: $14.40 Large trucks and sightseeing buses: $21.60 Drivers without E-ZPass can expect to pay even more come early January. Passenger vehicles will be charged $13.50 and motorcycles will have to pay $6.75 if a driver uses Tolls by Mail.\nHere’s what else drivers need to know before congestion pricing is set to begin next month.\nCongestion pricing is back Yes. In mid-November, Hochul officially reinstated congestion pricing for New York City.\nAt the press conference announcing this decision, the governor characterized her initial opposition to the program as a concern over the high cost for working New Yorkers.\nWhat is congestion pricing? Congestion pricing refers to using electronic tolling to charge vehicles for entering certain areas of Manhattan — the Congestion Relief Zone — during peak commuting hours. This aims to reduce traffic congestion and raise money for public transportation upgrades.\nRevenue generated from the program will be bonded against and to fund around $15 billion worth of capital projects in the city’s aging transit systems.\nWhat is the Congestion Relief Zone? As part of the $175 billion state budget approved on April 1, 2019, the MTA’s Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority will establish the Central District Business Tolling Program.\nThis will charge travelers a fee for driving into Manhattan’s Congestion Relief Zone, defined as any area south of 60th Street, but excludes certain highways in the area.\nWhen will this start? The official start date for the plan, according to Gov. Kathy Hochul, will be midnight on Sunday, Jan. 5.\nAt that point, the program’s myriad cameras will come alive and begin charging drivers a once-a-day fee either through E-ZPass or the Tolls by Mail program.\nOvernight hours Toll rates will be discounted during overnight hours, which are defined as weekdays from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. and weekends from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m.\nAdditionally, Hochul said she wants to lower tolls by 75% overnight to encourage more nighttime deliveries in the city.\nAs such, passenger vehicles with E-ZPass will pay $2.25 and motorcycles will pay $1.05 when entering into the CRZ overnight.\nWill tolls increase? The MTA recently revealed that while the toll has been lowered, it can be raised as early as 2028 and again in 2031 .\nThe toll for passenger vehicles can grow to $12 as soon as 2028, and then to $15 as soon as 2031 — the original cost of the toll before Hochul paused the program in June .\nCrossing credits Drivers entering the CRZ via the Queens-Midtown, Hugh L. Carey, Holland or Lincoln tunnels will be offered crossing credits against the toll.\nHowever, due to the lowered toll, drivers will now be getting crossing credits that are reduced by 40% when compared to the original plan.\nDrivers who come into the CRZ via the Holland and Lincoln tunnels will receive a $3 credit, while drivers who use the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel or Queens-Midtown Tunnel will receive a $1.50 in credit.\nDiscounts & Exemptions Drivers who make under $50,000 per year will receive a 50% discount on the standard toll for all crossings after their first 10 trips each month.\nAs previously required by state law, emergency vehicles and those carrying people with disabilities will be exempt from the program, with tax credits in place for residents living within the CRZ and earning less than $60,000.\nThe MTA will also offer discounts for people disabilities or health conditions that prevent them from using transit. More information on discounts can be found here .\nTransportation alternatives Along with Thursday’s announcement, Hochul said that the MTA will be adding more service to at least 23 bus routes, putting a high priority on adding more frequent trips for the outer boroughs.\nFour express bus routes on Staten Island were selected earlier this year for expanded service that coincided with the original start date of the program. These include the SIM1C , SIM4C , SIM23 and SIM24 .\nThere were also two routes selected in Brooklyn — the BM2 and BM5 lines.\nThe other 17 routes will soon be selected by the MTA.\nThe funding for this extra service will come from the transit authority’s Outer Borough Transportation Account, which was created, and fully funded, to provide $50 million a year to improve transportation outside of Manhattan in preparation for congestion pricing.\nNYC congestion pricing Could NYC congestion pricing plan be halted in court before Jan. 5 start?
