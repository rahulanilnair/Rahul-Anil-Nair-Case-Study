FAQ - New Privacy Policy\nDonald Trump Published December 17, 2024 6:00am EST Trump's proposed tariffs: what consumer products could be impacted? Experts say produce, medications, apparel, and footwear prices could all increase as a result of the proposed tariffs Facebook Twitter Comments Print Email By Eric Revell FOXBusiness close\nvideo Canada cannot win a tariff war with Trump: Alberta Premier Danielle Smith Alberta Premier Danielle Smith discusses Canadas investment in securing their southern border and her willingness to work with Trump on The Big Money Show.\nPresident-elect Trump campaigned on using tariffs as a tool to secure more favorable international trade terms and bring in tax revenue, but they could impact the prices paid by consumers for imported products.\nAmong the policies Trump has floated include an across-the-board tariff of 10% or 20% on all goods imported into the U.S., as well as a larger tariff of 60% on goods imported from China. He also said he would impose a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico. At a press conference on Monday, Trump and one of his nominees to a key Cabinet post signaled they want to use tariffs to secure reciprocal trade terms with other countries.\nCommerce Secretary-designate Howard Lutnick spoke at a press conference on Monday with President-elect Trump and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, who announced the Japan-based firm will invest $100 billion in the U.S. Lutnick responded to a press question about the incoming administration&apos;s tariff plans and explained that Trump \"has a very clear agenda for tariffs, and I think reciprocity is something that is going to be a key topic for us. How you treat us is how you should expect to be treated.\"\nTrump weighed in and said, \"Tariffs – properly used, which we will do – and being reciprocal with other nations, it will make our country rich… I always say, to me, tariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary.\"\nTRUMP, SOFTBANK CEO ANNOUNCE $100B INVESTMENT TO CREATE 100,000 AMERICAN JOBS\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has pledged to use tariffs as a key part of his economic agenda. (Donald Trump reacts at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tenn. / Getty Images)\nThe president-elect also pushed back on concerns the tariffs could raise prices for consumers based on the experience of his first term, saying, \"I didn&apos;t have any inflation and I had massive tariffs on a lot of things.\"\nUncertainty over how the tariffs will be implemented and the impact of the import taxes on consumers is likely to persist until the new administration takes office on Jan. 20, 2025, and begins to move forward with its preferred policies. Based on some of Trump&apos;s policy proposals from the presidential campaign, trade experts think there could be a significant price impact for consumers.\n\"Depending on the nature and the rate and how it&apos;s structured, it could be pretty substantial,\" Clark Packard, a research fellow at the Cato Institute&apos;s Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, told FOX Business about the impact of tariffs on consumer prices . \"He talked on the campaign trail about a 10% to 20% tariff on all imports, and then a special duty of like 60% on imports from China. If that were to go into effect, you know it would certainly raise consumer prices.\"\n\"I&apos;ve seen a study showing that the price of a laptop, for example, would increase by about $350 and a smartphone by about $200,\" Packard said. \"That assumes full pass through of the tariff cost to a retail buyer, but a lot of the best economic research shows that about 90% of the cost of a tariff gets pushed back to consumers.\"\nTRUMP SAYS HE WILL ISSUE EXECUTIVE ORDER TO CHARGE CANADA, MEXICO 25% TARIFF ON GOODS UPON TAKING OFFICE\nImported goods include finished products as well as intermediate inputs used in products completed by American firms. (Mario Tama/Getty Images / Getty Images)\nDr. Madhav Durbha, group VP of CPG and manufacturing at RELEX, told FOX Business, \"Items like avocados, mangoes, and other fresh produce heavily sourced from Mexico are highly vulnerable to tariffs. Geographic and environmental constraints make it difficult to shift production, and these tariffs would translate directly into higher prices for consumers at grocery stores.\"\nDurbha added that the U.S. imports pharmaceutical ingredients used in producing everyday medications from China and that tariffs on such imports \"could increase drug costs for consumers and disrupt supply chains, creating ripple effects across the health care industry.\"\nHe said that while many apparel and footwear brands have adopted the \"China plus one\" strategy of diversifying production to countries like Vietnam and Cambodia, tariffs on China could potentially increase costs on those goods for consumers.\nMUSK SAYS TESLA&apos;S MEXICO FACTORY ON PAUSE OVER TRUMP&apos;S TARIFF PLEDGE\nPresident-elect Donald Trump delivers remarks next to Chairman and CEO of SoftBank Masayoshi Son, at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., on Monday, Dec. 16. (Reuters/Brian Snyder / Reuters)\nDurbha added that a similar dynamic has played out with consumer electronics, like laptops and smartphones, which could be subject to price hikes or availability delays despite more production moving from China to countries like India and Vietnam.\nPackard also noted that imposing tariffs to tax imported goods would also have an impact on American manufacturers and exporters, because foreign countries are likely to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports in response.\nHe explained that \"40% to 50% of all imports are intermediate inputs that American firms use to make their products more globally competitive, and so when you start raising the price of inputs that American firms are buying abroad, you&apos;re going to make the finished product less competitive in global markets.\"\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\"When you impose a tariff, you&apos;re going to see retaliation from foreign governments,\" Packard explained. \"So not only are you a producer in the U.S. and your prices have increased because the goods you need have increased in price, you&apos;re going to see higher tariff barriers when you go to export the product as well.\"\nU.S. Stock Market Quotes\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Arrives Weekly Get Our Newsletter Get a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\nSubscribe By clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
