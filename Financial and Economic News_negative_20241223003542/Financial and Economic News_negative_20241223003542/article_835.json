    "text": "Outgoing government brought down by no-confidence vote did not meet expectations, says association head\nThe German Association of University Professors and Lecturers (DHV) has welcomed the national elections set to be held in February, following the collapse of the government due to a no-confidence vote.\nIn science policy, among other fields, the outgoing government “lacked a common will to shape the future—to the detriment of science”, DHV president Lambert Koch said on 16 December, the day of the collapse of the coalition led by chancellor Olaf Scholz (pictured).\n“After an initial spirit of optimism…the end result was mostly stagnation,” Koch said. “There was no significant improvement in the situation of young academics, there was no progress on the research data law, and the indispensable exchange with scientists stalled because the scientific community’s trust…was completely exhausted.\n“A fresh start in terms of content and personnel, based on a coherent overall concept, is therefore urgently needed.”\nKoch said that, in view of the difficult budgetary situation across Germany, which is in a technical recession, it will be important to set priorities in the future legislative period.\n“Anyone who wants to secure prosperity and innovative strength must continue to invest in education and science,” he said.\nThe DHV added: “If Germany wants to maintain its position as a centre of science and research in the face of an increasing shortage of skilled workers in this sector, the federal and state governments must finally pull together to ensure attractive career prospects in science.”",
