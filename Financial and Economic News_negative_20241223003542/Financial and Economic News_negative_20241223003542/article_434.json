    "text": "The New Year's Table in Azerbaijan Will Rise in Price by 6% Amid Food Price Increases\nThe cost of preparing a traditional New Year's feast in Azerbaijan will rise by 6% this year, reflecting broader inflationary trends in food prices, according to monitoring conducted by the Turan agency. The analysis, based on a consumer basket of 30 essential food items, underscores notable price increases for vegetables, meats, and dairy products over the past year.\nThe data reveals that the total cost of the monitored basket increased from 156.78 Azerbaijani Manat in December 2023 to 167.08 Azerbaijani Manat in December 2024, marking a 6% annual rise. This increase, though moderate compared to previous years, highlights persistent pressures on consumer purchasing power.\nVegetables experienced the steepest price surges, led by cucumbers, up 43% to 3.35 Azerbaijani Manat per kilogram, and cabbage, which rose 40% to 0.69 Azerbaijani Manat. Tomatoes, another staple of the Azerbaijani table, saw a significant price jump of 25%, reaching 2.99 Azerbaijani Manat per kilogram.\nMeat products also contributed to the overall inflation. Lamb prices climbed 11%, rising from 18.00 Azerbaijani Manat to 20.00 Azerbaijani Manat per kilogram, while beef edged up 3% to 15.50 Azerbaijani Manat. Conversely, poultry prices remained relatively stable, with chicken meat increasing by a modest 1.5% to 5.55 Azerbaijani Manat per kilogram.\nDairy products exhibited mixed trends. Cheese recorded a sharp increase of 21%, now costing 8.49 Azerbaijani Manat per kilogram. Milk prices rose 10% to 2.09 Azerbaijani Manat per liter, while yogurt saw a notable decline of 17% to 3.09 Azerbaijani Manat. Butter and corn oil, staples for Azerbaijani cooking, experienced slight price decreases of 0.21% and 10%, respectively.\nAmid broader inflation, several products remained stable or declined in price. Eggs, sugar, and local biscuits saw no change over the year. Rice and yogurt prices dropped significantly, by 15% and 17%, respectively, offering relief for cost-conscious consumers.\nEconomic analysts attribute the price rises to a combination of factors, including fluctuations in domestic agricultural output, increased transportation costs, and global commodity market trends. Seasonal demand ahead of New Year celebrations is also a contributing factor, particularly for vegetables and meat.\nConsumers in Azerbaijan, where traditional holiday celebrations feature rich spreads of fresh produce, meats, and dairy products, are feeling the pinch. \"We are seeing higher prices for almost everything we buy for the New Year's table,\" said one shopper in Baku's bustling markets.\nDespite government efforts to stabilize food prices through subsidies and market regulation, external pressures and climatic challenges continue to impact domestic production. Analysts anticipate further price volatility in 2025, particularly for imported food items and vegetables.\nFor now, Azerbaijani families preparing for the New Year will face a higher bill at the checkout, a reflection of persistent inflationary trends in the broader economy.\nProduct Name |\n1.12.2023 |\n3.12.2024 |\nDifference Compared to 1.12.2023 |\nBeef |\n15.00 |\n15.50 |\n+ 0.50 % 3 |\nLamb Meat |\n18.00 |\n20.00 |\n+ 2.0 % 11 |\nChicken Meat |\n5.47 |\n5.55 |\n+ 0.08 % 1 |\nChicken Giblets |\n3.70 |\n3.90 |\n+ 0.20 % 5 |\nWhite Fish |\n45.0 |\n50.0 |\n+ 5.0 % 11 |\nButter |\n18.50 |\n18.29 |\n- 0.21 % 1 |\nCorn Oil (1 liter) |\n5.93 |\n5.29 |\n- 0.64 % 10 |\nMargarine |\n6.09 |\n6.29 |\n+ 0.20 % 3 |\nEggs (10 pcs) |\n1.60 |\n1.60 |\n0 |\nGranulated Sugar |\n1.59 |\n1.59 |\n0 |\nSugar |\n2.49 |\n2.10 |\n- 0.39 % 15 |\nSalt |\n0.54 |\n0.59 |\n+ 0.05 % 9 |\nFlour (1st grade) |\n0.61 |\n0.65 |\n+ 0.04 % 6 |\nVermicelli (1 kg) |\n1.45 |\n1.53 |\n+ 0.08 % 5 |\nBuckwheat (1 kg) |\n1.09 |\n1.50 |\n+ 0.41 % 37 |\nMacaroni (1 kg) |\n1.45 |\n1.53 |\n+ 0.08 % 5 |\nRice |\n3.89 |\n3.29 |\n- 0.60 % 15 |\nMilk (1 liter) |\n1.89 |\n2.09 |\n+ 0.20 % 10 |\nSour Cream (100 g) |\n0.68 |\n0.71 |\n+ 0.03 % 3 |\nYogurt (1 liter) |\n3.75 |\n3.09 |\n- 0.66 % 17 |\nCheese |\n6.99 |\n8.49 |\n+ 1.50 % 21 |\nLocal Biscuits |\n3.20 |\n3.20 |\n0 |\nPotatoes |\n0.85 |\n0.99 |\n+ 0.14 % 16 |\nOnions |\n0.59 |\n0.79 |\n+ 0.20 % 33 |\nCucumber |\n2.39 |\n3.35 |\n+ 1.04 % 43 |\nTomatoes |\n2.39 |\n2.99 |\n+ 0.60 % 25 |\nCabbage |\n0.49 |\n0.69 |\n+ 0.20 % 40 |\nApples |\n0.99 |\n1.29 |\n+ 0.30 % 30 |\nHerbs (1 bundle) |\n0.17 |\n0.20 |\n+ 0.03 % 17 |\nTotal |\n156.78 |\n167.08 |\n+ 10.30 % 6 |",
