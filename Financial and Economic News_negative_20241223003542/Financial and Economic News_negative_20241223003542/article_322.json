    "text": "Addison Perry Updated: 12-17-2024 05:58 AM Levi & Korsinsky, LLP is reaching out to investors concerning Dentsply Sirona Inc. This follows the announcement of a class action securities lawsuit which aims to recover losses for those who have been negatively impacted by alleged misconduct by the company. Understanding the Class Definition The lawsuit encompasses individuals who invested in Dentsply during a specified period. Those affected by purported securities fraud may be entitled to seek recovery of their financial losses. It is vital for investors who believe they have been wronged to understand that they might have legal rights to restitution based on these claims. Allegations Against Dentsply Sirona Inc. The core of the complaint indicates that there were numerous misleading statements made by the company's representatives, as well as a failure to disclose critical information. Investors were led to believe that Dentsply was engaging in ethical practices, while in reality, the situation was markedly different. Allegations include targeting low-income demographics for dental aligner services, despite many having underlying conditions that could have made them ineligible for treatment. Case Details Unveiled The lawsuit sheds light on several serious claims against Dentsply. It points out that the push for increased sales resulted in staff possibly overlooking necessary evaluations for potential patients of their Byte aligner system. Furthermore, it has been noted that a significant number of injuries stemming from the usage of Byte products were reported over a substantial timeline, indicating that the company was aware of these issues but failed to act accordingly. The Implications of Inaction Dentsply's alleged inaction regarding patient injuries raises significant concerns. The complaint details how the company neglected to report serious injuries to the relevant regulatory bodies, which might have been necessary given the circumstances. This inaction could point to a broader pattern of prioritizing profits over patient safety and proper regulation.
