    "text": "TLDR Mark Longo, owner of viral internet sensation Peanut the Squirrel, sent a cease and desist letter to Binance for alleged copyright infringement over PNUT memecoin PNUT memecoin reached a $2.27 billion market cap after Binance listing on November 11th, but dropped 10.2% following the legal warning The legal letter demands Binance stop using Peanut‚Äôs image and trademark by December 31st, 2024 Longo has previously launched his own memecoins (JUSTICE and JFP) in protest of others profiting from his late pet PNUT is currently trading at $1.10, maintaining a market cap above $1 billion despite recent controversy A new legal dispute has emerged in the cryptocurrency world as Mark Longo, owner of the late internet celebrity Peanut the Squirrel, takes action against major crypto exchange Binance over alleged copyright violations related to the PNUT memecoin.\nLongo, known online as ‚ÄúPeanuts Dad,‚Äù announced on Sunday that his legal team had sent a cease and desist letter to Binance. The letter accuses the cryptocurrency exchange of unauthorized use of intellectual property, specifically referring to a copyrighted photograph of Peanut wearing a cowboy hat and the trademarked names ‚ÄúPEANUT THE SQUIRREL and PNUT.‚Äù\nThe story behind PNUT began with Peanut‚Äôs rise to internet fame through Longo‚Äôs viral videos, which attracted over half a million Instagram followers. However, tragedy struck when authorities seized Peanut and another rescued animal, Fred the raccoon, from Longo‚Äôs home. Both animals were euthanized for rabies testing, as current CDC protocols don‚Äôt allow for testing living animals.\nPublic outrage over Peanut‚Äôs death led to criticism from lawmakers and sparked the creation of several memecoins. Among these, the Solana-based PNUT token quickly gained traction in the crypto market, reaching a market capitalization of $120 million within its first week.\nThe token‚Äôs growth accelerated after Binance listed PNUT for spot trading on November 11th. This move catalyzed a price surge that pushed the memecoin into the top 10 by market capitalization, eventually reaching a peak of $2.27 billion in value.\nFor the past month, PNUT has maintained a market capitalization above $1 billion, with its price fluctuating between $1.80 and $1.00. However, the recent legal challenge has caused market uncertainty, leading to a 10.2% price drop from $1.17 to $1.05 within 24 hours of the announcement.\nThe cease and desist letter sets a deadline of December 31st, 2024, for Binance to acknowledge receipt and confirm they have stopped all activities that allegedly infringe on Longo‚Äôs intellectual property rights. Longo has indicated that this is just the first of several legal notices to be issued to various crypto exchanges.\nThis isn‚Äôt Longo‚Äôs first involvement with memecoins. He has previously expressed strong opposition to others profiting from his deceased pet‚Äôs image. In response, he launched his own memecoin called Justice for Pnut and Fred (JUSTICE), though this project faced criticism over insider trading allegations.\nMore recently, Longo promoted another token, Justice for Peanut (JFP), in the same post where he announced the legal action against Binance. This token experienced a dramatic 159% price increase following his post but quickly lost these gains.\n1/ $JUSTICE is heavily controlled (~80%) ‚ö†Ô∏è\nMark Longo ( @Squirrel_Dad12 ) accused the crypto community of profiting from the death of his squirrel, Peanut\nIn response, he launched a memecoin: JUSTICE\nLet‚Äôs break it down üßµ ‚Üì pic.twitter.com/6WTBHUHs1y\n‚Äî Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) November 25, 2024\nThe legal notice specifically targets Binance‚Äôs use of Peanut‚Äôs image and associated trademarks in their listing and promotion of the PNUT token. The letter argues that these elements are being used without proper authorization from Longo, who holds the rights to Peanut‚Äôs intellectual property.\nTrading data shows that PNUT has experienced increased volatility since the legal challenge became public. The token‚Äôs current trading price of $1.10 represents a 5.1% decline in the daily timeframe, though it continues to maintain a substantial market presence.\nMarket observers have noted that despite the legal uncertainty, PNUT‚Äôs trading volume remains active across various exchanges. The token continues to hold its position as one of the larger memecoins by market capitalization, even as it faces these legal challenges.\nThe timing of the legal action comes during a period of increased scrutiny of memecoins in the cryptocurrency market. Various regulatory bodies have been examining the role and impact of these tokens in the broader crypto ecosystem.",
