    "text": "about 1 hour ago • 2 mins\nFind out what happened in the markets today – and why you should care – with the free Daily Brief newsletter.\nWhat’s going on here?\nThe Indian rupee hit a new record low of 84.93 against the US dollar, rebounding slightly to 84.8950, mainly due to a hefty trade deficit worsened by gold imports.\nWhat does this mean?\nIndia's trade deficit jumped to an all-time high of $37.84 billion, driving the rupee to its weakest level against the dollar. The fall was worsened by surging gold imports, which increased the deficit. The Reserve Bank of India appeared to have intervened through state-run banks to ease the decline, as foreign banks likely increased their dollar bids for custodial purposes. On the flipside, financial markets suffered: both the BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 dropped over 1%, heavily swayed by struggling financial [stocks](/glossary/stock) and Reliance Industries. This has unsettled investors just when attention is on the US Federal Reserve's upcoming policy decision, expected to include a 25 basis point rate cut. ING Bank suggests that while this cut is on the table, further rate changes might pause amid ongoing [inflation](/glossary/inflation) worries.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: The domino effect of currency lows.\nThe rupee's plunge poses challenges for the Indian stock market. As the currency weakens, investor sentiment falls, causing losses in major indices like the BSE Sensex and Nifty 50. With weak performances from key sectors and companies, markets are in a delicate spot. This situation intensifies as global attention rests on the US Federal Reserve’s actions – any change in rate policy or outlook could ripple further through international markets.\nThe bigger picture: Global currents shaping local realities.\nThe rupee's weakening isn't isolated; other Asian currencies like the Thai baht are similarly declining as the US dollar strengthens. It highlights how international monetary policy, especially the Federal Reserve's moves, significantly affects emerging markets. With global inflation concerns still present, the interaction between major economies' policy decisions and currency values is vital, shaping economic prospects and investment strategies globally.\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.
