    "text": "During the holiday season , attacks by cybercriminals increase as they design specific traps to deceive consumers during the holiday season, for example by placing bait based on searches and purchases made online.\nWolfgang Erhardt Varela, national spokesperson for the Credit Bureau, explained that in December people They are more attractive to criminals for two reasons: one is because they have the bonus, there is extra money in their pocket and they also want to spend it.\nhave been detected two different types of fraud one is for those who want to buy, so these people invest create fake Internet pages, fake profiles on social networks and ads on different platforms where they offer the products most requested by buyers, such as televisions, laptops, headphones, video game consoles, with prices lower than those dictated by the market.\nThen they pretend to be a legitimate business but they are not, the site asks for the customer’s name, address, email, payment for the chosen item and, when he inserts the credit or debit card, it empties it at incredible speed.\nonline purchases \" loading=\"lazy\"/>\nSEE ALSO Digital platforms that Profeco does not recommend for making online purchases\nProfeco analyzed digital suppliers in Mexico to verify shipping processes\nWhen the customer realizes this and tries to complain to the bank about unrecognized charges on one of their cards, the highest possibility is that it will not be successful because it is a matter of lack of customer security , where he voluntarily gave information about his cards to a stranger.\n\"To take care of the issue of purchases a little, especially online, if you find an item or an offer that seems very interesting to you and seems to come from a legitimate business, even from a famous platform, my advice would be that you do not enter the advert but that you go alone to the company website, where you are interested in making the purchase, you confirm that the advert you have seen is legitimate, that the offer is there, if there is one, you are already making the your purchase, if it is not there, then you already know where it came from the ad is a scammer,\" he commented.\nThere are also cases where the site has a similar email address to some legitimate companies, where they change a digit during domain registration and people leave under the excuse of visiting the correct page.\nTo take care of the cards, the spokesperson also recommends downloading the mobile banking application and generating a virtual card there for making single-use purchases, on which you can preload the desired amount and once the purchase is made, the card disappears , that is, the number cannot be repeated. So, in the worst case scenario where you are affected, you will only lose the money you have pre-loaded.\nAnother very common fraud this season concerns those who need credit to get ahead of New Year or on the slopes of January, which is already approaching. People come across advertisements for small loans that are easy to obtain, fast, without consulting the Credit Office.\n“Most likely these are credits that don't exist, where the criminal wants you to make your credit application and scan your voter ID card or your passport, proof of address, that kind of documents, to steal your identity, to those who can then impersonate you, try to obtain official documents in your name or even financing that the criminal will not pay and which you would then have to claim before the Bureau,” he explained.\nWolfgang Erhardt Varela pointed out that if you find an interesting offer, perhaps from a company you don't know and have never heard of, and you have no idea where a branch is, you can check the site Condusef.gob.mx, where you can find the records of all the legitimate and regulated companies in Mexico to apply for credit in the formal sector.\n“Speaking of formalities, there are times when someone may recommend you to a third person, who is a natural person who gives loans informally, you have to be careful with them, it could be a very expensive loan and it could be a dangerous loan, so only apply for financing from duly regulated institutions in Mexico,” he added.\n#careful #search #hooks #scams",
