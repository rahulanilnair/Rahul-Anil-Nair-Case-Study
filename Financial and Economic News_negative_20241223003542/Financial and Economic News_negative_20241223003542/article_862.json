    "text": "Amid growing concerns over cryptocurrency volatility, Thomas Peterffy, chairman of Interactive Brokers, has highlighted the potential for a Bitcoin BTC/USD crash to significantly impact the stock market in 2025. During an interview with Bloomberg, Peterffy emphasized the risks associated with high leverage levels in the financial system. What Happened: Peterffy noted that margin balances have been climbing rapidly, with bitcoin being a primary area of margin-based risk-taking due to low fees on bitcoin futures offered by the CME. He warned that a sudden drop in bitcoin’s value could compel investors to liquidate assets to meet margin calls, potentially leading to bankruptcies and market instability. “I am very worried that people overextended themselves,” Peterffy said. In October, FINRA margin debt reached its highest level since February 2022, approximately $815 billion, according to YCharts data. Peterffy also pointed out that MicroStrategy MSTR has raised considerable debt to bolster its bitcoin holdings, which could worsen the situation if bitcoin’s value falls sharply. Despite Peterffy’s concerns, bitcoin recently hit record highs above $107,000.

According to Bernstein analysts, the recent pullback in bitcoin’s price below $95,000 was attributed to routine leverage adjustments rather than fundamental issues, suggesting investors should “buy the dip.” Despite this, the volatility has raised concerns among traders. Additionally, a crypto analyst reassured investors that the current bull run might still have room for growth, despite recent market turbulence. The analysis highlighted that the market is not near a top, indicating potential for further gains. These differing perspectives underscore the uncertainty surrounding bitcoin’s future trajectory and its potential impact on broader financial markets. Price Action: As per Benzinga Pro , Bitcoin was trading at $1,06,955.20 at 8:13 am ET on Tuesday. Meanwhile, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY which tracks the S&P 500 closely was slightly down by 0.38% and Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 QQQ had dropped by 0.27%.
