The biggest one is what Trump does, particularly in terms of tariffs. The second one is what China does in terms of stimulus in response to that,” said Macquarie analyst Alice Fox.\n“Our base case is the copper market will be oversupplied next year. There will be new mine supply coming through.”\nMacquarie expects mine supplies to rise 5.4% to nearly 24 million tons next year and a surplus of 300,000 tons.\nA higher U.S. currency makes dollar-priced metals more expensive for holders of other currencies, which subdues demand.\nTraders said commodity trading advisors (CTAs) using this relationship in their numerical models had been selling copper.\nThe dollar is likely to hold firm next year as the market expects the Federal Reserve to cut U.S. rates only very gradually. It is expected to cut interest rates on Wednesday.\nElsewhere, aluminium touched a one-month low of $2,528 a ton as concern about surpluses surfaced after data showed output in top producer China rose in November. It was last down 1.3% at $2,533.\nHowever, physical market premiums for aluminium in the U.S., paid above the LME price, have jumped as the U.S. relies on imports, which would become more expensive with tariffs.\nThey are around $480 a ton from levels near $420 before the U.S. election.\nIn other metals, zinc slipped 0.9% to $3,029, lead retreated 0.2% to $1,997, tin fell 0.5% to $29,100 and nickel ceded 0.8% to $15,580.\nCopper Copper prices copper import London copper LME copper copper market Comments 200 characters Pakistan\nPakistan records $729mn current account surplus in November 2024",
