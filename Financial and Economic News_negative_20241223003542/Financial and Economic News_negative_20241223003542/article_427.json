    "text": "Ulat sa Asya: Bumagsak ang karamihan sa mga pamilihan habang naghahanda ang China na itaas ang depisit sa badyet\nAng mga merkado ng Asia-Pacific ay nagsara ng halo-halong noong Martes habang hinihintay ng mga mamumuhunan ang desisyon ng rate ng interes ng US Federal Reserve at tinasa ang mga pag-unlad sa patakaran sa pananalapi ng China.\nChinese leaders announced plans to increase the country's budget deficit in 2025, aiming to sustain economic growth at around 5% next year.\n“Asian markets experienced mixed performance overnight, as investors await a series of interest rate decisions from central banks, including the Federal Reserve, scheduled for this week,” said Patrick Munnelly at TickMill.\n“Chinese equity markets showed modest gains; reports suggest that Beijing aims to set a growth target of around 5% for the coming year, alongside increasing the budget deficit to 4% of GDP.\n“Chinese economic activity remained weak in November, with industrial production steady at 5.4% year-on-year, but retail sales growth fell to 3.0% year-on-year from 4.8% in October, below the expected 5%.”\nMunnelly noted that consumer confidence in the country remained low, impacting consumption, which is tied to the property market outlook.\n“House price declines slowed, with new homes at -6.1% year-on-year and used homes at -8.5%.\n“Activity is improving in tier-one cities, but there is a significant overhang of unsold homes - 60 million to 80 million - nationwide.\n“Property investment is decreasing, and while there are pockets of interest, the market needs to reach equilibrium between supply and demand for stability.”\nMost markets in the red, Australasia goes against the grain\nJapan's Nikkei 225 dipped 0.24% to 39,364.68, while the broader Topix nahulog 0.37% sa 2,728.20.\nWeakness in semiconductor stocks weighed on the market, with chip-testing equipment maker Advantest pabulusok na 9.35%.\nFurukawa Electric at Nissan Motor also declined, losing 4.03% and 3.93%, respectively.\nSa Tsina, ang Shanghai Composite bumaba ng 0.73% sa 3,361.48, at ang Bahagi ng Shenzhen bumaba ng 0.35% sa 10,537.43.\nLosses in Shanghai were led by sharp declines in smaller-cap stocks, with Saurer Intelligent Technology, Fujian Dongbai Group, at Shanghai Shibei Hi-Tech Co each falling over 10%.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index slid 0.48% to 19,700.48, reflecting pressure in health and consumer stocks.\nZhongsheng Group Holdings nawala ang 3.4%, JD Health International tumanggi ng 3.24%, at Sinopharm Group bumaba ng 2.93%.\nTimog Korea Kospi 100 saw the sharpest regional loss, down 1.44% to 2,448.53.\nBattery and materials stocks weighed heavily, with Kumyang pagbagsak ng 10.3%, Posco Future M bumababa ng 8.24%, at Mga Materyales ng EcoPro bumaba ng 6.62%.\nAustralia bucked the trend, with the S & P / ASX 200 gaining 0.78% to close at 8,314.00.\nProperty and biotech stocks led the charge, as Pangkat ng Pexa tumaas ng 8.2%, Digico Infrastructure REIT umakyat ng 7.21%, at Mesoblast tumaas ng 6.01%.\nSa kabila ng Tasman Sea, New Zealand's S & P / NZX 50 also posted gains, rising 0.91% to 12,914.30.\nMagtitingi Mga Tatak ng KMD led the market higher with a 7.59% gain, followed by Mercury NZ at Skellerup Holdings, tumaas ng 4.75% at 4.6%, ayon sa pagkakabanggit.\nIn currency markets, the dollar was last 0.23% weaker on the yen to trade at JPY 153.80, while it strengthened 0.52% against the Aussie to AUD 1.5778, and advanced 0.4% on the Kiwi, changing hands at NZD 1.7365.\nOil prices extended declines, with Brent crude futures last down 0.77% on Yelo sa $73.34 kada bariles, at ang NYMEX quote para sa West Texas Intermediate na bumaba ng 1% hanggang $70.00.\nChina set to raise budget deficit, consumer confidence slips in Australia\nSa mga pang-ekonomiyang balita, Reuters reported that China was set to raise its budget deficit to 4% of GDP in 2025, marking a record high, as leaders in Beijing aimed to sustain economic growth at around 5%.\nThe proposed increase, up sharply from the current 3% target, would translate to roughly CNY 1.3trn yuan (£140.67bn) in additional government spending.\nReuters said the decision, apparently made at last week’s Central Economic Work Conference, was still to be officially announced.\nMeanwhile, Australian consumer confidence fell in December amid persistent inflation, high interest rates, and global economic uncertainty.\nAng Westpac consumer sentiment index declined 2% from November to 92.8 points, indicating continued pessimism among households.\nWhile sentiment had improved over the course of the year, it remained below the 100-point threshold that separates optimism from pessimism.\nElsewhere, Singapore reported a stronger-than-expected recovery in non-oil domestic exports (NODX) for November, driven by gains in electronics.\nNODX rose 3.4% year-on-year, reversing October’s 4.7% contraction and surpassing forecasts for a 0.7% decline.\nOn a month-on-month basis, exports surged 14.7%, far exceeding expectations of an 8% increase and recovering sharply from a 7.5% drop the previous month.\nPag-uulat ni Josh White para sa Sharecast.com.",
