    "text": "DUNKIRK No holiday spirit in tax increase\nCity of Dunkirk taxpayers have a real lump of coal in their stockings this Christmas. Despite months of knowing about the fiscal crisis, elected officials did nothing to hold constituents harmless when it came to passing the buck.\nOn Saturday, council approved an 84% property tax increase. That hurts, especially for 18% of the population that is classified as a senior citizen and on a fixed income. It is painful for the more than 25% who are living in poverty. Even if these residents do not own homes, rents will be going up to compensate for that massive increase.\nIf there is a glimmer of palatable news, it is this. Residents know whatever amount they paid last year to the city will be almost double when the tax bill comes.\nAccording to the city website, city taxes are mailed out the first week of April and normally due the first week of May. At least that gives property owners some time since county taxes are normally due after the first of the year.\nDunkirk has made a lot of excuses in the last eight months for the budget problems. Their lack of action — and passing their mistakes on to residents in the form of the increase — is insulting.\nJust remember how careless the administration and council has been with your money in the past. They voted themselves a bonus with your tax dollars in 2021. They bought new equipment and never once have asked for a balance sheet to know exactly where they stood financially.\nNone of these actions were responsible. It was downright greedy — and done with no consideration for the city residents.\nNow, those residents will be paying for years of negligent financial oversight. Happy new year.",
