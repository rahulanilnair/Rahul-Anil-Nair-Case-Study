    "text": "The Ukrainian market in the wheat sector last week saw a slight increase in prices. Flour mills continued to complain about the lack of grain supply, so they were ready to raise purchase prices, trying to attract additional volumes of grain. Agrarians continued to restrain sales of quality grain and mainly offered feed wheat and wheat of 3rd class. There were almost no offers of class 2 wheat. However, due to difficulties with flour sales, many sellers considered further price increases inexpedient. Traders' demand also slightly decreased, which put pressure on prices. Prices for 2nd class wheat were mainly fixed within the range of 9700-10700 UAH/t CPT, and for feed wheat - 8400-9400 UAH/t CPT.
