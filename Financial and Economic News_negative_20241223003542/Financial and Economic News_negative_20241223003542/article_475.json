    "text": "Govt uncertain on cryptocurrency regulation timeline; why it’s a problem for consumers Sharveya Parasnis on December 17, 2024 December 17, 2024 3 minute read 3 minute read\nThe government of India has set no timeline for Virtual Digital Assets (VDA) regulation like cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFT), revealed an answer to a question in parliament on December 16. “Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) are by definition borderless and require international collaboration to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Therefore, any comprehensive regulatory framework on the subject can be effective only with significant international collaboration on evaluation of the risks and benefits and evaluation of common taxonomy and standards,” said the Ministry of Finance.\nDespite this, the government brought VDAs under the purview of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) and taxed cryptocurrency withdrawals.\nWait-and-watch approach in cryptocurrency regulation? Commenting on the parliament response, Ajay Kumar, Partner at Triumvir Law, stated that the government seemed to be following a wait-and-watch policy. “It’s good that the government is taking its time, as bad regulation can be worse than no regulation. The G-20, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and other global groups need to have a lock-step approach where they don’t ban VDAs outright but mitigate their potential for money laundering,” he said.\n“It is very difficult to regulate the inflow and outflow of capital to VDAs as they can be transferred to anyone outside of the RBI’s scrutiny purview,” he added.\nCryptocurrencies are also risky to use as they are not traceable and one cannot reverse transactions with a court order. “This puts consumers at risk from fraudulent transactions,” said Kumar “On top of that, cryptocurrency transactions are settled in real-time on the blockchain without intermediaries, making it difficult for users to dispute transactions at a later date.”\nWho Would Regulate Cryptocurrencies? According to Kumar, the government would also have to clarify the regulatory agency in charge of VDAs. While the RBI is in charge of governing currencies, VDAs like cryptocurrencies don’t seem to be used that way. “Bitcoin was originally supposed to be a currency, but it is now being used more as a capital asset or investment vehicle,” said Kumar.\nJust today, the Jodhpur Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) also stated that Bitcoin qualified as a capital asset since it grants ownership rights and can be bought, sold, or transferred.\n“A merchant is perfectly at liberty to reject a purchase if it is made in cryptocurrencies. The point of legal tender currency is that people have to accept it if given,” Kumar added.\n“On the other hand, for SEBI to regulate VDAs, they would have to fit the definition of securities under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act. Ideally, parliament will have to clarify this,” he said.\nWhat Does A Lack Of Regulation Mean For Consumers? “It’s the Wild Wild West now. There’s no better way to put it,” commented Dinkar Kalra, advocate on record at the Supreme Court.\nAdvertisements “Lack of regulation means basically you’ve allowed organisations and individuals to mislead investors. Cryptocurrency is an unregulated entity about which users, I understand know very little. That in itself leaves enough scope for manipulation,” he added.\nHe gave the example of cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, which got into hot water this year after a cyberattack left it in the lurch for $230 million. The exchange attempted to “socialise” its losses amongst users by locking 45% of everyone’s cryptocurrency holdings. Kalra had previously attempted to organise WazirX users and take legal action.\nHe also had a number of recommendations for regulations that would protect consumers and investors in the cryptocurrency market:\nMandatory insurance for all institutions that hold cryptocurrencies on behalf of other users. Due diligence before a coin is listed. “Today, anyone can today launch an initial coin offering (ICO) and just scam people. Look at what happened with the Hawk Tuah coin. They put it up for sale. So many people bought it, and they literally pulled the rug from underneath it,” said Kalra. Investor education, similar to what banks provide to investors in mutual funds or stocks. Regulations should prohibit cryptocurrency holding institutions from mixing user funds with their own treasury. External security and financial audits for exchanges. Regulations should allow for peer-to-peer transactions between users, but they should take into account Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering Rules.
