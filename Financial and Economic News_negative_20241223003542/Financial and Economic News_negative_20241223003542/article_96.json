    "text": "Free trade is out of steam\nThis event is organized by the WU Department of Economics\nThe pandemic and Putin’s energy policy have thrown the risks of foreign economic dependencies into stark relief. At the same time, populists are attacking the very world trade rules that have made global prosperity possible. China and the USA are decoupling, and globalization is being rolled back. The EU is focusing increasingly on sanctions, supply chain laws, and climate protection – geopolitical and ecological interests are pushing free trade aside. The prosperity of countries like Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, whose wealth is based on trade and small and medium-sized enterprises, is under threat. In their new book, Gabriel Felbermayr and Martin Braml discuss possible ways of safeguarding and even expanding this prosperity.\nKeynote:\nGabriel Felbermayr, Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO); professor of economic policy, WU Vienna\nModerated by:\nGerlinde Fellner-Röhling, Full professor and Deputy Head of Economics Department, WU Vienna\nThis event is an in-person event and will take place on campus.
