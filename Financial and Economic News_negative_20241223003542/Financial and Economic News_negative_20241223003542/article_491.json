You can check out at any time. More info\nA consortium of councils says there is \"no viable solution that is significantly cheaper\" after renewed attacks on a proposed incinerator scheme at Teesworks by a prominent critic.\nCouncillor Dr Tristan Learoyd said the Tees Valley Energy Recovery Facility (TV ERF) due to be constructed on the Grangetown Prairie site, west of Tees Dock Road, which is part of the Teesworks industrial complex, could \"bankrupt\" the local authorities involved, a claim branded \"erroneous\". Cllr Learoyd, who previously wrote to Energy Secretary Ed Miliband calling for a halt to the project, claimed a new carbon tax being introduced by the Government in 2028, which will place a cap on the volume of emissions allowed from such facilities, could potentially lead to a £950m bill over the lifetime of the project, leading to \"huge council tax rises\".\nThere were 60 fully operational energy from waste plants in the UK at the end of last year, which generated about 3.1% of the country's total net power generation and kept 16 million tonnes of residual waste from heading to landfill. But critics of incinerators argue that generating energy from burning waste contributes to greenhouse gas emissions compared with renewable power and may deter efforts to cut single-use plastics and improve recycling.\nOnce operational, the Teesside plant will burn up to 450,000 tonnes of general rubbish annually from seven councils - Darlington, Durham, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Newcastle, Redcar and Cleveland and Stockton - generating almost 50,000 megawatts of electricity – enough to power the equivalent of 60,000 homes.\nA statement on behalf of the project partners said: \"Final costs for the TV ERF contract are still subject to a live procurement process, but the project partners can categorically state that there is no viable alternative solution which has been…",
