    "text": "By Charlie Lankston\nThe median home price would be out of her range but for her endorsements\nWNBA star Caitlin Clark has been named Athlete of the Year by Time magazine, joining an elite group of athletic superstars including Lionel Messi, LeBron James, Simone Biles, and Aaron Judge.\nBut while 22-year-old Clark's sporting skills and impact arguably rival those of her fellow honorees, there is one aspect of her career that puts her out of step with many of the other title recipients: her salary.\nIn April, Clark, who was raised in West Des Moines, Iowa, was selected by the Indiana Fever as the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft, just days after wrapping up a historic NCAA career that saw her catapulted to superstar status.\nThe basketball star inked a four-year deal worth $338,056-with a base salary for 2024 of just $76,535, an incredibly low sum when compared with the contracts signed by male players in the NBA.\nJames' first contract, which he signed in 2003, for example, also saw him signed to a team for four years. However, he earned $18.8 million for the privilege.\nIn fact, Clark's WNBA salary is so low that it cannot even buy her a property listed at the average median price in the U.S., which currently stands at $416,880 as of November 2024. Coupled with the most recent mortgage rate of 6.69%, Clark would need to earn $83,668 to afford a median-priced property with a 30-year mortgage.\nAccording to the Realtor.com affordability calculator, if Clark were to try to buy a home in Indianapolis-where her team is based-she would be best placed looking for a property with an asking price of around $326,000, or $383,300 if she wanted to stretch her budget.\nThankfully for Clark, she does not rely solely on her WNBA income to pay her way. In fact, according to a recent report by Sportico, her annual salary made up just 1% of her earnings in 2024.\nThe outlet reports that Clark raked in a \"record\" annual fortune of $11.1 million, almost all of which was generated away from the basketball court, via sponsorship deals, endorsements, and the NIL (name, image, and likeness) money she earned while still playing at Iowa State in the earlier months of the year.\nMore from Realtor.com: Texas Trailer Is Transformed Into a Dramatic $550K 20-Room 'Tin Castle' Wild Structure Is the Week's Most Popular Home\nClark's superstardom on the court while at college helped to turn her into a global phenomenon and saw her establish sponsorships with a wide variety of brands, including an eight-year deal with Nike (NKE) that is worth an estimated $3 million a year.\nOther major brand endorsements include Gatorade, Xfinity (CMCSA), and State Farm.\nHowever, Clark certainly doesn't appear to be living beyond her means, revealing in June that her younger brother is living with her. She joked that she spent at least some of her time away from the court watching him play video games.\nMore from Realtor.com: Inside the Hamptons' Most Expensive Home: $425 Million 110,000-Square-Foot Estate Is Owned by Billionaire Tied Up in Lead Poisoning Scandal\nShe conceded, though, that her fame has altered her way of life, with Time reporting that she now has an \"advance security squad\" to guard her against over-zealous fans.\n\"I tell people I feel like the most controversial person,\" said Clark, who has been the subject of some furious online backlash. \"But I am not. It's just because of all the storylines that surround me. I literally try to live and treat everybody in the same exact respectful, kind way. It just confuses me at times.\"\nClark is not the only WNBA athlete in this unique position. Angel Reese, her on-court rival, also enjoys a luxurious lifestyle that is far beyond what her annual on-court salary would afford her.\nMore from Realtor.com: 10 Surprising Countries To Get a Golden Visa Through Real Estate Investment\nReese, who plays for the Chicago Sky, admitted in October that she was \"living beyond her means,\" adding that she doesn't know the amount she makes from her basketball career alone.\n\"Hatin' pays them bills baby,\" she told her followers. \"I just hope y'all know the WNBA don't pay my bills at all. I don't even think that doesn't pay one of my bills.\n\"Literally, I'm trying to think of my rent rent for where I stay at. Let me do the math real quick. ... I don't even know my salary-74 [thousand]?\"\nMore from Realtor.com: Surprising Massachusetts City Hits No. 1 on the Hottest Housing Markets List-Yet Owes Its Rank to Another City\nIn fact, Reese's salary for her first season with Chicago Sky was $73,439-which makes up part of the $324,383 four-year contract she signed with the team.\nBut, much like Clark, Louisiana State University alum Reese earns a hefty salary away from the court courtesy of her many endorsement deals. In 2023, following her team's NCAA championship bout against Iowa (Clark's college team), Reese's estimated potential NIL earnings jumped to a staggering $876,000, according to On3. Meanwhile, Clark's soared to $739,000.\nThis story originally ran on Realtor.com.\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.
