    "text": "Stock Market Crash : Indian benchmark equity indices Sensex and Nifty50 lost around a percent on Tuesday, December 17, extending losses for the second straight session. The benchmarks were dragged by index heavyweights Reliance Industries, Infosys, and HDFC Bank, as investors remained cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s December 18 meeting for signals on its rate cut trajectory.\nThe BSE Sensex shed as much as 807 points, or 1 percent, lower to its intra-day low 80,941.61. Meanwhile, the Nifty50 was down 247.75 points, or 1 percent to its day’s low of 24,420.5. Broader markets, however, outperformed the benchmark with Nifty Midcap and Nifty Smallcap down just 0.06 percent each.\n“Globally markets will be looking forward to the FOMC outcome on Wednesday. Markets have already discounted a 25bp rate cut and, therefore, the focus will be on the Fed chief’s commentary. Any departure from a dovish commentary will be a negative from the market perspective. This is only a remote possibility. The US services PMI coming strong at 58.5 percent indicates a resilient economy, which augurs well for the market.\nThe sharp spike in India’s trade deficit to $37.8 billion in November will put pressure on the rupee pushing it towards 85 to the dollar. Exporters like IT and pharma will benefit from depreciating rupee and for importers the import cost will increase. This will have an impact on their stock prices,” said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.\nStocks and Sectors Among Sensex stocks, Adani Ports was the only constituent in the green while the remaining 29 stocks were negative. HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel and L&T were the top draggers in the index.\nMeanwhile, on Nifty 4 stocks – Adani Ports, Cipla, Adani Enterprises, and Tata Motors were positive, while the remaining 46 were in the red. Shriram Finance, Bajaj FinServ, Grasim, Bharti Airtel and PowerGrid were the top losers in the index.\nOn the sectoral front, On the sectoral front, Nifty Bank, Nifty Financial Services, and Nifty Oil and Gas lost over a percent each while Nifty Auto, Nifty FMCG, Nifty IT, and Nifty Metal declined over half a percent each. Nifty Media and Nifty Realty gave positive returns, up around 1 percent each.\nTechnical View Rajesh Bhosale Technical Analyst- Angel One\nThe benchmark index has experienced insignificant developments as it retreated into the slumber phase. Encouragingly, market breadth has shown a slight favor toward the bulls, suggesting the potential for positive sector rotation despite the current subdued performance of the key indices. The 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level around 24770 continues to be a crucial barrier, as recent attempts to decisively surpass it have all failed. Until we see an apparent breakthrough, the Nifty is likely to consolidate within a narrow range. On the lower end, 24600-24500 provides a supportive buffer that is likely to cushion any shortcomings from the comparable period. The week is led by many macro developments across the globe, which may act as catalysts in setting up the tone for our markets; hence, it is important to stay vigilant. Meanwhile, the ongoing thematic trends are keeping traders engaged, and it is essential to focus on these key movers to achieve outperformance in a lackluster market environment.\nCatch all the Business News , Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.
