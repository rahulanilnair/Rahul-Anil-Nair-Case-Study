    "text": "Reliance shareholders face first negative returns in 10 years\n[Mudit Dube](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/author/mudit/142)\n[Mukesh Ambani]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/business/mukesh-ambani )-led [Reliance Industries Limited (RIL)]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/business/reliance-industries ) is on course to end 2024 with negative returns for the first time in a decade.\nThe company's market capitalization has eroded by over ₹4.4 lakh crore since its July peak as RIL shares have plummeted nearly 21% from their peak of ₹1,608.95.\nThe decline comes after a strong growth phase, including a 70.55% return in 2017 and steady growth till 2020.\nFactors contributing to RIL's market decline\nThe return on RIL shares dropped to 19.32% in 2021, 7.60% in 2022, and 1.44% in 2023. This year, the bellwether stock is on track for its first annual decline since 2014. The decline in RIL's market performance can be attributed to slowing growth, rising costs, and increased competition. Analysts have identified slower growth, newer competitors in retail space, and escalating real estate costs as major challenges for the company.\nReliance Retail faces weak demand and competition\n[Reliance Retail](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/business/reliance-retail) (RR) has struggled with weak demand, particularly in [fashion](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/career/fashion-design), and headwinds from operating in a high-base environment from last year.\nThe company shut 1,185 stores amid sluggish revenue growth despite higher footfalls.\nHowever, Jefferies remains positive on RR given its scale and industry leadership.\nJPMorgan suggests potential drivers for RIL's stock gains\nJPMorgan also highlights RIL's fair relative valuations and suggests that stronger refining margins or higher retail valuations could drive stock gains.\nDespite negative free cash flow due to telecom spending, RIL is expected to generate positive free cash flow moving forward.\nAmbani targets a 2025 listing for [Jio]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/business/jio ), which analysts value at over $100 billion.\nThe retail unit's IPO will follow after overcoming internal business challenges post-2025.\nAmbani's net worth drops amid RIL's market challenges\n[Ambani's net worth fell](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/business/ambani-adani-removed-from-bloomberg-s-2024-richest-list/story) from $120.8 billion in July to $96.7 billion on December 13.\nAmbani is eyeing digital platforms, retail brands, and renewable energy for future growth.\n[Elon Musk](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/science/elon-musk)'s Starlink's potential entry into India's satellite broadband market threatens Jio Platforms's growth.\nReliance has also forged a joint venture with Walt Disney for an $8.5 billion media giant targeting India's streaming market.",
