He's raising concerns about the recent appointment of a former N.L. Hydro executive to the top post at the board that regulates electric utilities in the province. (Eddy Kennedy/CBC - image credit) Ron Penney is a former senior public servant in Newfoundland and Labrador and outspoken critic of the controversial Muskrat Falls project. He's raising concerns about the recent appointment of a former N.L. Hydro executive to the top post at the board that regulates electric utilities in the province.\nRon Penney, an outspoken critic of the overbudget Muskrat Falls hydro project, is raising concerns about potential pitfalls of the newly announced Churchill Falls deal. (Eddy Kennedy/CBC)\nA long-time civil servant with his eye on hydro projects says he wants to see a referendum on the newly announced Churchill Falls hydro deal — and has words of caution about what the deal could actually mean for Newfoundland and Labrador's finances.\nRon Penney, a former deputy minister of justice for Newfoundland and Labrador and a fierce critic of the costly Muskrat Falls megaproject, says he'd like the newly announced memorandum of understanding with Quebec to face scrutiny by the Public Utilities Board.\nADVERTISEMENT \"If they're not going to do that, then I think a better way of dealing with it — from the point of view of the electorate — is to have a referendum on this subject, not mix it up with everything else,\" Penney told CBC Radio's The St. John's Morning Show .\nThe next provincial election has to be called by the scheduled fixed-date vote on Oct. 14, 2025, though he believes it will be much sooner than that.\nPenney said he's glad that Premier Andrew Furey is committed to a debate on details of the MOU in the House of Assembly during a special sitting. Government House leader John Hogan said Monday the legislature will open Jan. 6.\n\"But that's likely not to shed much light on this. What we need to have is an independent review,\" he said.\nLISTEN | CBC's Heather Barett chats with Ron Penney on the newly announced Churchill Falls deal:\nADVERTISEMENT \"What I would like to see is the Public Utilities Board brought in to examine the MOU and then follow the whole course of the negotiations and have the agreement subject to the approval of the Public Utilities Board.\"\nWhile the MOU has to be finalized by 2026, Penney said the government shouldn't rush to get it completed by that deadline.\n\"I think we really need to be careful about this and not be driven by artificial deadlines,\" he said.\n\"We need to make sure that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past, particularly Muskrat Falls.\"\n'It's probably not our fair share'\nFor the past couple of days, Penney said he's been thinking about 2041 — when the contract, negotiated in 1969 and which took effect in 1976, is set to expire — and how this new contract will benefit Hydro-Québec by guaranteeing low prices for a long period of time.\nADVERTISEMENT He added that Hydro-Québec will be able to keep any increase to its residential rates below 3 per cent, adding that its rates are half that of N.L.\n\"When I read that, I realized, 'Gee, Hydro-Québec is really getting a wonderful deal on this.' And what I'm wondering and concerned about is that they've had the better of us,\" he said.\nUnder the proposed new terms, Quebec will be paying considerably more for electricity generated at Churchill Falls than the notorious current price, but Penney said it will still be very cheap even with an escalator clause for prices.\n\"We're going to be getting a tremendous amount of revenue — at least projected that we're about getting — [but] it's probably not our fair share.\"\nWATCH | Terry Roberts recaps the highlights of the tentative deal announced last week:\nADVERTISEMENT According to Thursday's announcement at The Rooms, N.L. is expected to receive about $17 billion over the first 17 years but Penney has reservations about that amount as well.\n\"It's obviously significant,\" he said. \"I don't think it's as significant as the premier says.\"\nHe also pointed to the Muskrat Falls rate mitigation plan that goes until 2030 — estimated to cost $3.5 billion in that period.\n\"So we have to find billions and billions of dollars over the next 30 or 40 years to keep our own rates. So that's going to cost us a lot,\" said Penney.\nMoreover, he said ensuring power to the island is also going to cost billions of dollars for the generating units at Bay d'Espoir and the Holyrood thermal generating station.\nChurchill Falls, Labrador.\nA sweeping Churchill Falls agreement is set to replace a 65-year contract that generations of N.L. politicians have fought. (Danny Arsenault/CBC)\nN.L.'s financial situation \"is not that great,\" he said, and there are plans to build new hospitals and other types of infrastructure.\n\"So I'm not sure it's the saviour that the premier says it is,\" said Penney.\nPositives in deal\nPenney said he welcomes the plan for Hydro-Québec to be responsible for building two of the newly announced projects — the massive Gull Island hydroelectric development and the Churchill Falls plant expansion — because the Quebec corporation has a good record.\n\"I think we're in safe hands there. Now there I do have a caveat with that, because they're going to own 40 per cent of the projects, which means that 40 per cent of the profits are going to go to them,\" he said.\n\"And whether or not the people of the province are agreeable to that, I don't know.\"\nDownload our free CBC News app to sign up for push alerts for CBC Newfoundland and Labrador.
