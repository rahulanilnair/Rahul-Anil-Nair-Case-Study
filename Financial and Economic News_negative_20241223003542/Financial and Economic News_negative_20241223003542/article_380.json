    "text": "OPENING CALL\nStock futures were lower on Tuesday, with the Federal Reserve due to begin its two-day rate-setting meeting.\nInvestors overwhelmingly expect the Fed to opt for another quarter-point interest-rate cut. The bigger question is whether the resilience of the economy will lead the central bank to take a more cautious approach to policy easing going forward.\nThe prospect of rates staying higher for longer has begun to weigh on parts of the stock market.\nWhile tech stocks have continued to rally, smaller companies and others that are highly sensitive to the economic outlook have come under pressure.\nOverseas Markets\nOverseas stocks were mostly lower.\nU.K. bond yields rose after unexpectedly hot wage-growth data led investors to trim bets on future Bank of England rate cuts.\nPremarket Movers\nAffirm Holdings was down 2.7% after the company announced a private offering of $750 million of convertible senior notes and said it plans to repurchase up to $300 million of common stock.\nAmentum shares were higher after it swung to a quarterly profit.\nBroadcom was up 1.1% after it closed at a record high, jumping 11% to $250.\nCoinbase, Mara Holdings and MicroStrategy rose alongside bitcoin prices.\nNvidia was down 2.1% after shares fell into correction territory on Monday.\nRed Cat Holdings was down 11% after the company reported a fiscal second-quarter loss of 18 cents a share.\nSolarEdge Technologies rose 11% after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to Buy from Sell and boosted its price target to $19 from $10.\nSuper Micro Computer was on track to extend a selloff that followed the news it will be removed from the Nasdaq-100. The stock lost 2% premarket, following Monday's 8% slide.\nTesla was up 2.5%. The stock finished Monday up 6.1% to $463.02, a record closing high. Wedbush boosted its price target on the stock to $515 a share, from $400.\nPostrmarket Movers\nEVgo said that EVgo Holdings, an affiliate of LS Power Equity Partners IV, is launching a secondary offering of up to 23 million shares of Class A common stock. Shares dropped 19%.\nMitek Systems reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that beat analyst expectations. Shares rose 15%.\nNovonix said it received a conditional commitment for a direct loan of up to $754.8 million from the Energy Department. Shares rose 9.7%.\nWatch For:\nRetail Sales for November; Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for November; Canada CPI for November\nToday's Top Headlines/Must Reads:\n- Will the Fed Keep Cutting in 2025?\n- CEOs Are Feeling a Lot More Upbeat About the New Year\n- Tech Firms Are Chipping In for Trump's Inauguration. How the Gifts Stack Up.\nMARKET WRAPS\nForex:\nThe dollar rose as it continued to buck seasonal weakness due to a high short-term swap rate, ING said.\nThe Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday but it's likely to signal that future cuts will be cautious, as markets anticipate, it said.\nUnless the Fed signals more cuts than market pricing implies, the two-year dollar overnight index swap rate around 4% should prevent the dollar from correcting meaningfully lower in a usually soft month for the currency, ING added.\nSterling rose after data showed U.K. wage growth accelerated by more than forecast.\nThe data offer a reason for Bank of England policymakers to sound more cautious about cutting interest rates, in contrast to the European Central Bank, ING said.\nThere is a \"compelling case\" for EUR/GBP to stay below 0.8300 in the near-term with risks skewed towards further falls.\nThe BOE is likely to keep rates on hold Thursday, highlighting the \"striking policy divergence\" with the ECB, which cut rates by 25 basis points last week.\nBitcoin hovered near record highs on optimism over Donald Trump's upcoming second term as President and major bitcoin holder Microstrategy joining the Nasdaq 100, Swissquote Bank said.\nBonds:\nThe Treasury yield curve is expected to continue steepening next year, DWS said.\nThe steepening of the curve, where the gap between short- and long-dated bond yields widens, should be driven by falling short-term yields, the German asset manager said.\nDriven by falling short-term yields as inflation eases, the steepening is expected to continue with anticipated interest-rate cuts, it added.\n\"To benefit from the expected shift in the curve, we believe that exposures with shorter to medium maturities are best suited.\"\nEnergy:\nOil prices eased further after a disappointing batch of data from China fueled concerns over demand and as traders await the Fed's last policy meeting of the year.\nAccording to ANZ Research, China's oil refining slid its lowest since June due to seasonal maintenance, while year-to-date oil demand was down 3.3% to 14 million barrels a day.\nFears of sluggish demand in the top crude importer and prospects of a global supply surplus next year have been putting significant pressure on prices in recent months.\nInvestors now wait for cues on the U.S. interest rate outlook for next year, as lower rates typically boost demand for oil.\nMetals:\nGold prices fell ahead of the Fed's policy meeting, with traders cautiously waiting for clues on the central bank's outlook for 2025.\nMeanwhile, PMI data showed the services sector rose at a faster-than-expected pace.\n\"The resilience of the U.S. economy supports our view that the Fed's 2025 rate cutting cycle is likely to be shallow,\" ANZ Research said.\n\"We expect a signal that future moves will be gradual.\"\nTODAY'S TOP HEADLINES\nAlibaba Expects to Book $1.28 Billion Loss on Sale of Department Store\nAlibaba Group is set to book an over $1 billion loss on the sale of its department-store chain Intime, which marks the Chinese tech giant's latest move away from offline retailing.\nThe company said Tuesday that it and a minority shareholder have agreed to sell Intime to textile and clothing firm Youngor Group for gross proceeds of around 7.4 billion yuan, equivalent to around $1.02 billion.\nNew investigation rips Amazon's safety record. That's not slowing the tech giant's stock.\nInjuries at Amazon.com Inc.'s warehouses are more common than in other warehouses, a new government report alleged over the weekend, claiming that the online-retail giant manipulated injury data and ignored recommendations to keep workers safer as it pursued speed and profits.\nThat 160-page report - released on Sunday by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, which is chaired by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders - arrived amid a holiday shopping rush that could generate record consumer spending, and after Teamsters workers at two warehouses in New York and a third in Illinois voted to authorize a strike.\nBroadcom's AI Success Won't All Come at Nvidia's Expense\nThere's a new trillion-dollar AI chip maker in town. The old one is still going to do just fine.\nBroadcom's fiscal fourth-quarter report last week included a long-term forecast for its artificial-intelligence business that has lighted up its stock price and pushed the company's market capitalization past $1 trillion. It also appears to have done the opposite for Nvidia: The AI chip titan's stock has shed about 4% over the past two days while Broadcom's has surged by 38% in that time.\nBiden Administration Agrees to Record $15 Billion Loan to PG&E\nThe Biden administration will provide a record $15 billion low-interest loan commitment to California utility company PG&E to support hundreds of projects aimed at fighting the effects of climate change and improving the electrical grid.\nThe loan by the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office is slated to fund projects that refurbish PG&E's hydroelectric infrastructure and upgrade power lines to support renewable energy projects, data centers and electric vehicles.\nBank of Japan Rate Decision Looks like a Close Call as Uncertainties Rise\nExpectations that the Bank of Japan is close to raising its policy rate are swirling ahead of the conclusion of its closely watched meeting on Thursday. According to people familiar with the BOJ's thinking, policymakers generally agree that domestic economic conditions are \"on track\" for steady inflation backed by wage growth.\nRecent inflation and wage data suggest conditions are conducive for a hike, backing the case for the BOJ to raise its policy rate to 0.50% from 0.25%. But the bank may hold fire if some policymakers opt to wait for more clarity about the outlook for the U.S. economy, the people said. Other policymakers, they added, think that the impact of President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies is unlikely to be clear by the next meeting in January, and that the bank doesn't have to wait for full details.\nWhy This Frothy Market Has Me Scared\nThe market feels toppy. There is no science to this and readers will have to judge for themselves. But here are a bunch of things that make me think trouble might be imminent for stocks-perhaps a correction, perhaps the start of something bigger, but at least a bump in the road.\nBulls are everywhere. Bears are hard to find. This shows up in sentiment, in surveys and in the capitulation of the permabears.\nRetail Sales Are a Litmus Test for Holiday Spending. What They'll Show.\nNovember's retail sales report will be an early litmus test for the strength of consumer spending this holiday season-and will help the Federal Reserve decide whether to make a rate cut later this week.\nRecent economic releases-including last week's consumer price index-have given investors little reason to doubt the Fed will cut rates again when the Federal Open Market Committee wraps up its meeting Wednesday.\nUkraine Says It Killed Senior Russian General in Moscow Scooter Bombing\nUkraine said it killed a senior Russian general in a Moscow bombing after a device planted in a scooter exploded early Tuesday, a rare targeted assassination of a high-profile military official in the capital.\n(MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n12-17-24 0616ET\nShare © Dow Jones - 2024",
