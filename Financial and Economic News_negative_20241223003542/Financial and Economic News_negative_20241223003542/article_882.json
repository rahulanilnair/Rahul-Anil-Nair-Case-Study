    "text": "Romania tops first among EU members with highest price increases\nThe end of 2024 finds Romania in the first place in a EU ranking of price increases with a strong downturn of Romanians’ purchasing power, according to data issued by Frames, a consulting company. Christmas and New Year’s Eve holidays triggered highest price increases with manufacturers and traders competing in offers (some as small as 100 grs) in a marketing strategy designed to preserve customers’ loyalty in times of unprecedented inflation rise. For 10 months now, Romania reported largest price increases in food, clothing, electronics, services etc. In 2023, highest price level among EU countries was reported in Denmark – some 43% above the EU average – while in Bulgaria and Romania the price level was 40% below the EU average.\nTalks resume among Romania’s pro-European parties\nRomania’s pro-European parties are resuming talks on Tuesday concerning a governing programme based on a common set of reforms. Results are expected on Friday, December 20, when a new parliament meeting is scheduled. Talks yesterday failed to agree on next year’s budget making the center-right Save Romania Party (USR) to withdraw from a meeting last night. The move made the center-left Social Democrat Party (PSD), center-right National Liberal Party (PNL), and Hungarian minority’s Democratic Union of Ethnic Hungarians in Romania (UDMR) to announce they were ready to form a government without the USR in case tha party decides to withdraw from the talks. PSD, PNL and UDMR also pointed out they were not discussing the distribution of power in a new government while reiterating their decision to announce a joint candidate in the presidential elections scheduled next year. The move comes at a time when Bucharest mayor, Nicușor Dan, announced his intention to run independently for president whithout a support from the governing coalition.\nDay of mourning in Timișoara\nA day of mourning in Romania’s western city of Timișoara is expected to commemorate people who died in the city on December 17 at the start of Romania’s revolution in 1989. Religious services and wreath-laying ceremonies are scheduled at the Metropolitan Cathedral and at the Cemetery of Heroes in the city. The first 66 protesters were killed by the army on December 17. In mid-December 1989, events in Timișoara launched a revolution which resulted in overthrowing former Romanian Communist dictator Nicolae Ceușescu. Before the dicator and his wife, Elena, were sentenced to death and executed, over a thousand people were killed and several thousands injured in riots.\nAlexandru Danga",
