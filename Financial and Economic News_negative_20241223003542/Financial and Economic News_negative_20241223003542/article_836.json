But according to my backtesting by using a special type of gold trade, I would have seen a 141% gain in just a week. It happened again in March. Gold nudged up 1.2%. This time? A 104% overnight gain. And in June? A 1% gold move turned into a 74% gain in two weeks. Granted, there would have been smaller wins and those that did not work out, but you see, there's a reason I'm telling all my friends to hold off from buying gold or regular gold stocks right now. There's a more lucrative way to play the gold market as we enter a new breakout period.
