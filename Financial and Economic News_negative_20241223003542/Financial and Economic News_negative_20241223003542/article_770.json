    "text": "The budget was dire for retailers, and many of us still probably haven’t grasped just how much it will impact on us from all aspects of the business. I listened to the budget live and was roughly adding up the cost to my business as Rachel Reeves spoke.\nWhen we came to working out the figures properly, I had underestimated the costs by 20%. Every single cost that the budget added to the business came with absolutely no benefit. We have to build these costs in just to stand still, in an already tough market.\nThe disbelief this budget has brought is being felt across all sectors. I am also a farmer, and I joined the farmers’ protest in Whitehall where thousands congregated to vent their anger at an ill-thought-through budget. As I write, farmers have begun action at various ports across the country and will continue to do so.\nThe independent convenience sector is resilient. Changes keep coming down the tracks and we adapt accordingly. But this budget is going to test even the most innovative retailers.\nYes, we are all in it together, but individually we have to find solutions for our own businesses. Price rises are inevitable, unfortunately, as we cannot absorb such costs. Hopefully, now we have some certainty, the economy will pick up enough to fuel some sales growth for us all.\nThe chancellor had to make “tough decisions”. Now it’s the turn of every business owner in the country to do the same.\nJonathan James is the owner of [James Convenience Retail](https://www.jamesretail.co.uk/)\nRead the [December edition](https://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&edid=bea5d3e4-fe39-429d-b107-df6224faecc9) of Independent Retail News",
