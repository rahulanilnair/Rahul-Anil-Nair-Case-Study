    "text": "A large market in Podgorica, whose price levels have been monitored by \"Vijesti\" for more than a year, in the last month removed several labels for products that are part of the state action to limit the \"Limited Price\" margin, and this was done for yogurt, toilet paper and bananas. The prices of the two items did not change in the meantime, while bananas went down by 20 cents.\nIn mid-September, the now disbanded Administration for Inspection Affairs told \"Vijesta\" that part of the traders do not respect the \"Limited Prices\". Then they explained that according to the Government's decision, traders are not obliged to mark products with a limited margin, so inspectors cannot even sanction them, and that in the first few days of the implementation of the action, they wrote fines in the amount of 55.000 euros.\n\"Limited prices\" were launched on September 6 and will last until January 31 of the following year, and after the recent change in the margins for 67 food and hygiene products, in wholesale and retail stores. Margin is the difference in the purchase and sale price of goods. Thus, margins for the food sector in wholesale and retail stores are limited to 10 percent, while for hygiene products they are limited to a maximum of 10 percent in wholesale and 15 percent in retail.\nThe purchase of a consumer basket with 15 items, the prices of which \"Vijesti\" follows, cost 47 euros in a large store in December last year, while today it is necessary to allocate 44 euros for the same. When it comes to the small market, it is also more favorable than last year, so what in the last month of 2023 had to pay 35,8 euros, costs 32,3 euros today. Compared to December last year, prices on the market did not change at all.\nThese are some of the results shown by the \"Vijesti\" monthly price barometer, which monitored the monthly price movements of 15 products in Podgorica's small and large markets and markets. The reporter went to these facilities once a month since September last year, in the middle of the month, in order to list the prices, monitor their movements and possible price increases or decreases. These are different foods, from the same manufacturer, of identical type and weight, in order to give a true picture of monthly changes.\nTag removed, price the same\n\"Limited prices\" also include toilet paper, yogurt and bananas, which were marked and highlighted as part of it on the shelves of a large market in mid-November. That changed in the meantime, so their prices remained, while the \"Limited prices\" labels were removed. Although \"Vijesti\" does not track the price of a liter of uncapped milk, it was not highlighted as part of the action either - although retailers did for other products.\nSo yogurt still costs 1,27 euros, toilet paper 2,49 euros, while bananas are now 20 cents cheaper and you have to pay 95 cents for them. The only item that has not been \"changed\" is the dish detergent, which still has the same markings and price - ie 2,49 euros.\nCompared to the prices in December last year, chicken and veal cost a few euros less in supermarkets today. Veal cost 2023 euros at the end of 15, while a kilogram of the same meat now costs 13 euros. The price of chicken in December last year was 9,6 euros, while today you have to pay three euros less, i.e. 6,5 euros.\nIn addition to these, milk with a cap is now about 30 cents cheaper, so you need to pay 1,15 euros for a liter, while apples are also about 15 cents cheaper.\nMore than half of the items on the list are more expensive today than they were in the twelfth month of last year, while two kept identical prices. Fish sticks were one euro cheaper, i.e. they cost 1,8 euros instead of the current 2,8 euros, while tomatoes were more than one euro cheaper. The prices of cucumber, yogurt, toothpaste, chocolate and ham were also lower, while toilet paper cost about 20 cents less.\nIn the last month, there was no price increase in the supermarket, but now apples are 40 cents cheaper, tomatoes 20 cents and cucumbers 10 cents cheaper.\nLast year, chicken was 2,5 euros more expensive\n\"Limited prices\", however, do not apply to markets whose square footage at the state level is less than 600 square meters, so the action does not apply to the one the reporter is visiting. Thus, in a small shop, compared to December last year, today chicken is 2,5 euros cheaper, that is, you have to pay 8,5 per kilogram instead of 11 euros at the time. A liter of milk is cheaper by about 35 cents, caladon and ham by 20 cents, while apples and eggs are 20 cents cheaper.\nOn the other hand, today in a small market, a kilogram of cucumber is more expensive by 30 cents, so you have to pay 1,5 euros for them, instead of 1,2 euros last year. Fish sticks, bananas, tomatoes are also slightly cheaper...\nCompared to last month, today yogurt and cucumbers are about ten cents more expensive in a small market, while 30 cents less should be allocated for chocolate and about 20 cents less for ham.\nPrices on the market are almost identical to those of December 2023, with the fact that apples are ten cents cheaper, so a kilogram costs 1,2 euros. There was no change on a monthly basis.\nThe state action initially included 66 products (51 food and 15 hygienic), but at the end of November the Government adopted a decision and slightly expanded the list, by correcting the existing one and adding a couple of domestic dairy products. Homemade yogurt and sour milk of all weights are now included in the \"Limited prices\", so there are a total of 52 food items on the list.\nIn addition to these, an earlier measure to limit margins on five basic foodstuffs, namely sunflower oil, crystal sugar, type 400 and 500 flour and table salt, is in force.\nWith the new government decision, one-liter cow's milk in a bag was included among these five from the food group. This means that this list now consists of six foods. The maximum margin on these products in wholesale is five percent, while in retail stores it is limited to seven percent.\nThe Government said that the main reason for this move was the protection of domestic producers of dairy products, which have recently been threatened by cow fever.\nOctober without inflation\nIn October of this year, according to Monstat data, there was no monthly inflation, that is, prices did not change significantly compared to September. However, compared to the same month in 2023, they are on average 1,2 percent higher.\nIn September, deflation (negative inflation), i.e. a monthly drop in prices, was officially recorded for the first time this year. Deflation was recorded in the same period last year and in three consecutive months, in September, October and November.\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic Development Nik Đeljošaj said in mid-November that the monthly inflation rate in October was non-existent.\n\"It is clear that the action 'Limited prices', without jeopardizing the continuity of market supply, has influenced the stabilization and lowering of the prices of basic foodstuffs, as well as the overall low rate of inflation in Montenegro. The Ministry will continue to continuously monitor the prices of basic foodstuffs according to the established methodology and, accordingly, propose measures aimed at protecting the standards of citizens\", said Đeljošaj.\nBonus video:",
