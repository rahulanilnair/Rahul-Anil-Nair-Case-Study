    "text": "NEW YORK , Dec. 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (\"Chipotle\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: CMG ) of a class action securities lawsuit.\nCLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Chipotle investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between February 8, 2024 and October 29, 2024 .

If you suffered a loss in Chipotle during the relevant time frame, you have until January 10, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.\nNO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees.
