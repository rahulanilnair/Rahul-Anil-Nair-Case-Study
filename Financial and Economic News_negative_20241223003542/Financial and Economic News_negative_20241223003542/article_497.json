    "text": "Guernsey's gas prices will rise by 10% from January.\nThat means the average household will end up paying about £9.37 a month more.\n\"Geopolitical events across Europe have continued to impact the price of wholesale gas over the last 12 months,\" said Darryl Goddard, Managing Director of Guernsey Energy.\n\"Energy markets are subject to a variety of complex influences which impact our supply chain and keep the cost of services that are crucial to the supply of gas high.\n\"We understand that tariff increases can be difficult for our customers to manage, but given these circumstances they unfortunately cannot be avoided. We're continuing to invest heavily across our network and drive forward a comprehensive maintenance programme.\n\"Vulnerable customers can register on our Priority Care scheme, and we will assist them with safety checks, prioritising call outs, energy-saving advice, and by offering payment plans, where customers can spread the cost of their winter bills across the whole year if they sign up to a fixed Direct Debit.\"\nThe rise follows an 8% increase that was applied from the end of January this year.\nIn May, the company increased standing charges by an average of £1.13 a month.\nThe average prices are based on domestic heating Super Eco 24 tariff and the annual average consumption per customer on this tariff.\nCustomers can register for Priority Care by contacting IEG's team or visiting the website at [guernseyenergy.gg](guernseyenergy.gg).\nPictured top: Darryl Goddard, Managing Director of Guernsey Energy.\nComments on this story express the views of the commentator only, not Bailiwick Publishing.
