    "text": "Russian tankers spill devastates Black Sea ecosystem 17 December, 01:18 PM Share:\nA bird in fuel oil stains on the shore after the Russian tankers accident (Photo: Video screenshot / SHOT / Telegram)\nThe Russian oil tanker accidents in the Kerch Strait on Dec. 15 caused an estimated damage of more than $14 billion to the Black Sea ecosystem, Ukraine's Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk told her Romanian and Bulgarian counterparts during the Dec. 17 online meeting.\nThe estimate could change as more data comes in on fuel oil leaks from two sunken Russian tankers.\n\"Now we are waiting for better weather conditions to obtain high quality satellite imagery, which is necessary for analysis of the situation and more detailed modelling,\" she said, adding that the current focus is on documenting the pollution, modeling its spread and assessing its impact on ecosystems.\nAd\nAppeals have also been made to convene an extraordinary meeting of the Commission for the Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution and to conduct an independent assessment of the state of the waters and the marine ecosystem.\nRead also:\nEnvironmental damage in Ukraine exceeds $70 billion after 1,000 days of war An estimated 4,300 tons of fuel oil and possibly other oil products are leaking from the two sinking tankers, Volgoneft-212 and Volgoneft-239, which were caught in a storm and sank in the waters of the Kerch Strait , which connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.\nThe tankers' tracking systems were disabled at the time of the accidents.\nOn the same day, a Russian floating crane ship, designed to lift heavy loads, was reported to be in distress off the coast of the temporarily occupied Yalta.\nRead also: Ukraine urges Europe to counter Russia’s ‘shadow’ tanker fleet Will you support Ukraine’s free press?\nDear reader, as all news organizations, we must balance the pressures of delivering timely, accurate, and relevant stories with requirements to fund our business operations.\nAs a Ukrainian-based media, we also have another responsibility – to amplify Ukraine’s voice to the world during the crucial moment of its existence as a political nation.\nIt’s the support of our readers that lets us continue doing our job.
