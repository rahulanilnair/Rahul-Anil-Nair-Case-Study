    "text": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) is struggling to keep up speed in the cryptocurrency market as it faces competition. SHIB has lately had some gains, but its price hits significant resistance at the $0.00003 mark, which will test investors’ determination. While Rexas Finance , a new addition, is busy gaining a foothold in the meme coin space, promising a 21,000% ROI, the focus in the meme coin space has shifted.\nSHIB Price Fails to Penetrate Key Levels The price of Shiba Inu recovered over the weekend, climbing more than 5% in a few hours. The token still fluctuates around the key level of $0.00003, showing the equilibrium of buyers and sellers. The fact that the price can not try to slide again below this threshold is indicative of a bullish sentiment, with many buyers making sure that the price does not drop too much.\nLarge holders have increased their positions tremendously, an encouraging sign from on-chain data for SHIB. Further data reveals a 106.3% inflow of net SHIB token to the major wallets, with over 708.93 billion SHIB created in the previous 24 hours. In addition, significant holders added 1.136 trillion SHIB tokens valued at around $34.08 million in the past two days indicative of continued investor interest.\nRexas Finance Takes Investor Interest Rexas Finance is a game changer that tokenizes real-world assets to bring blockchain-focused investing to a whole new level. The platform facilitates fractional ownership of high-value assets, including real estate and art, thus allowing a greater diversity of investors. This method combines traditional asset markets with blockchain and has attracted global attention. By using Rexas Token Builder, Rexas Finance simplies asset tokenization and facilitates users to create and control digital tokens. What it does is it allows them to take illiquid assets and convert them into liquid ones, which allows for flexibility and diversification for investors. Furthermore, the Rexas Launchpad enables inimitable projects, brings them together, and guarantees that the ecosystem grows. It comes with advanced tools like the QuickMint Bot to help you create Ethereum-compatible tokens and Rexas GenAI, which is called not only an NFT management tool but also a minting tool. All of these innovations fit within the mandate to create an accessible, secure tokenized economy. With its CertiK audit passing with flying colors, this only reaffirms Rexas Finance’s dedication to transparency and reliability.\nRexas Finance Empowers Investors with Inclusive Presale Rexas Finance has a well-structured tokenomics strategy. It is driven by community engagement and long-term sustainability. However, its public presale gave out 42.5% of the total token supply, which seems inclusive. Rexas achieved something a lot of competing companies can’t: it didn’t accept venture capital, which meant that individual investors could access its ecosystem. It allocates 22.5% of tokens for staking rewards and an additional 15% for liquidity, pushing investor incentives. Marketing, partnerships, and giveaways are smaller potions to make your product visible and keep users engaged. Rexas Finance is also hosting a $1 million giveaway campaign that gives 20 winners $50,000 each in USDT.\nIts native RXS token will gain more liquidity and broader access to the market through upcoming listings on three Tier 1 exchanges. Such developments allow Rexas Finance to become a strong competitor in the cryptocurrencies market. Featuring a host of novel features and a thriving ecosystem, Rexas is ready to catch up with meme tokens and overshadow traditional tokens.\nConclusion Earlier today, the failure of Shiba Inu to stay above the $0.000020 support level showed that crypto is facing a challenging market, made worse by emerging competitors like Rexas Finance. Despite positive trends in SHIB’s on-chain data, there are roadblocks in the path of its momentum that threaten to hamper its long-term future. Rexas Finance, however, has been attracting investor attention through its bold claims and a slightly innovative approach.\nWebsite: https://rexas.com\nWhitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdf\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinance\nTelegram: https://t.me/rexasfinance\nDisclaimer: The text above is an advertorial article that is not part of Coincu.com editorial content.",
