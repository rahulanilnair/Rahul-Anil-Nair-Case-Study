This was up 51% from 1.7% over the US Thanksgiving period last year.\nThe analysis reviewed attempted ecommerce transactions from across the globe and found that 4.6% of transactions worldwide were suspected to be Digital Fraud over this time period ? colloquially known as the Cyber Five. Based on proprietary insights from TransUnion's global intelligence network, TransUnion found that the global suspected Digital Fraud rate was down from 6.0% during the same period in 2023.\nThe study determined that the average volume of suspected Digital Fraud attempts on any given day during that holiday period globally was 30.2% lower than it was in 2023 and 5.9% lower than during the rest of the year (1 January 2024 to 27 November 2024).\nThe Percentage of Suspected Ecommerce Fraud during the Cyber Five vs. Overall",
