    "text": "Pune: A businessman in Pune was allegedly cheated of Rs 10 lakh by cyber criminals who offered him to open a Zudio franchise branch in the city, police said on Tuesday. The scammers used deceptively identical websites and email addresses, giving the appearance that all interactions were from Zudio, they said. According to the police, the 66-year-old man stumbled across an advertisement on the internet early this month that included a link to apply for the Zudio franchise. Since the complainant, who owns a paint dealership, was looking for new business opportunities, he clicked on the link and filled out the form, an Indian Express report added. As sought in the form, the man entered his personal, professional, and financial details. Police said, \\\"A while later, he received a call from a fraudster claiming to be a Zudio representative. He informed the complaint that his application had been approved and that senior corporate officials would contact him soon to discuss the next steps. A few hours later, he received another call from a man identifying himself as a senior functionary and requesting the complainant's income tax, company, and bank information.\\\" The complainant accordingly paid Rs 49,000 and Rs 10 lakh in ‘registration fees’ and 'agreement fee’ on separate occasions, the report further stated. According to police officials, he was informed that the agreement paperwork between the complainant's business entity and Zudio will be provided to him for signature. The businessman became suspicious when another person called him and demanded Rs 25 lakh to stock Zudio's apparel items. Following a preliminary inquiry by the Cybercrime Police Station, officers at the Khadak Police Station filed a case. In July last year, a 35-year-old director of an engineering firm in Pune was duped out of Rs 1 crore by online fraudsters under the guise of offering him the franchise of a multinational pizza chain during the Cricket World Cup. In a similar example last year, a 50-year-old tour operator in Pune was duped into paying Rs 30 lakh by fraudsters who gave him the franchise of a popular restaurant in the city. In October of last year, a 33-year-old guy from Pimpri Chinchwad was duped out of Rs 10 lakh by online fraudsters who promised him ownership of a franchise for a well-known bakery brand.
