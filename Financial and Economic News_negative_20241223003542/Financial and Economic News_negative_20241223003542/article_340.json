    "text": "Unpaid carers have been urged to apply for Pension Credit before the Winter Fuel Payment deadline.\nAccording to the charity Carers UK, only those receiving Pension Credit or means-tested benefits will receive the one-off Winter Fuel Payment of up to Â£300 to help pay energy bills from this winter.\nThere are 1.2 million unpaid carers over the age of 65 in England and Wales, with 729,000 of those providing over 20 hours of care per week and 551,000 providing over 50 hours per week.\nIt's really important to claim Pension Credit and to do so quickly before 21st December.\nFind out if you or your loved ones are eligible via the Age UK websiteâ€”you may also become eligible for other benefits, such as help with health and housing costsðŸ‘‰ https://t.co/AzSirDBvVz pic.twitter.com/4IAyaT9XGR\nâ€” Rebecca Long-Bailey (@RLong_Bailey) December 17, 2024 Pension Credit uptake is at just 66%, with up to 850,000 people over the State Pension age estimated to be missing out.\nRecent figures from Carers UK show the financial pressure that older carers are already under and the potential challenges they will face if the Winter Fuel Payment is removed from everyone apart from those in receipt of Pension Credit.\nData from the charityâ€™s State of Caring survey shows that 45% of carers aged 65 and over, who are not in receipt of Pension Credit, are worried about living costs and whether they can manage in the future, while 20% have had to cut back on essentials like food or heating.\nUnpaid carers are more likely to be eligible for Pension Credit. They can also get extra income worth up to Â£2,371 per year if they meet certain conditions. This top-up, called Carerâ€™s Addition, of Â£45.60 per week is added to Pension Credit if someone has an underlying entitlement to Carerâ€™s Allowance.\n\"Apply before the December 21st deadline\" Current benefit rules state that if someoneâ€™s State Pension is more than Carerâ€™s Allowance, they are not entitled to be paid Carerâ€™s Allowance.\nHowever, carers still need to apply for Carers Allowance to prove they have an underlying entitlement to the benefit, which would increase their chances of being eligible for Pension Credit and would increase the amount of a Pension Credit award.â€¯â€¯\nHelen Walker, Chief Executive of Carers UK, said: â€œAs it gets colder, weâ€™re urging all older carers to check whether they might be entitled to Pension Credit even if they think they arenâ€™t and to apply before the December 21st deadline.",
