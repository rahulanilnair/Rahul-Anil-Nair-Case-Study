    "text": "Read full article Evening Standard HS2 cost 'soars by £9bn' bringing total estimate of high-speed rail link to £80bn Ross Lydall December 17, 2024 at 3:53 p.m. · 4 min read Link Copied HS2: its new ‘bullet trains’ will be able to reach 225mph (HS2)\nThe estimated cost of building the London to Birmingham leg of the HS2 high-speed line has increased by £9bn, according to reports.\nThis could mean the final bill for the first phase of the 225mph railway could reach £80bn at current prices.\nThe Euston to Birmingham Curzon Street part of HS2 was originally meant to cost £44.6bn at 2019 prices.\nA year ago the then Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, axed HS2’s northern extension amid fears the total bill was set to exceed £100bn.\nBut the public accounts committee said in February that cancelling HS2’s later stages offered “very poor value for money for the taxpayer” .\nADVERTISEMENT The latest cost revelation comes two days before Department for Transport and HS2 officials, including new HS2 chief executive Mark Wild, are due to appear before the public accounts committee to answer question about the project’s finances.\nAccording to the Financial Times , the Euston to Birmingham Curzon Street leg is now estimated to cost up to £66bn at 2019 prices, which is £9bn more than the £49bn-£57bn previously estimated by the HS2 board.\nThe Government’s most recent estimate is £45bn-£54bn. It believes HS2’s estimate should be cheaper because it does not include savings resulting from the cancellation of the northern leg.\nAccording to the FT, a DfT report due to be published on Tuesday will cite an HS2 board paper from June which puts the cost of the project at between £54bn and £66bn in 2019 prices.\nIt says that, once inflation is taken into account, £66bn would be close to £80bn in today’s prices.\nADVERTISEMENT The DfT said on Tuesday that it did not comment on “speculation”.\nIt said Mr Wild had been tasked with assessing HS2’s current cost and timeline, and to provide an action plan to deliver HS2 at the “lowest reasonable cost”.\nIn October, the then Transport Secretary, Louise Haigh , said: “It has long been clear that the costs of HS2 have been allowed to spiral out of control, but since becoming Transport Secretary I have seen up close the scale of failure in project delivery – and it’s dire.”\nThe Labour government admits it does not have an accurate figure for the latest cost of HS2.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves has committed to funding the cost of digging the HS2 tunnels between Old Oak Common and Euston stations – but has not said how much she expects this to cost.\nThe cost of building a HS2 station at Euston alongside the existing mainline station is also unknown, due to the plans undergoing another review.\nADVERTISEMENT Two weeks ago, rail minister Lord Hendy told The Standard : “Currently – as a new Government – we don’t know how much it’s going to cost or how long it’s going to take.”\nThe Old Oak Common to Birmingham section is due to open around 2030 but there is no timeline for the Old Oak Common to Euston section.\nThe new HS2 station at Euston will only have six platforms, according to a written parliamentary answer from Lord Hendy.\nThe new ⁦ @HS2ltd ⁩ station at Euston will have six platforms, confirms rail minister ⁦ @LordPeterHendy ⁩ (so no return to previous plans for 11 or 10 platforms) pic.twitter.com/281RjaHFOH\n— Ross Lydall (@RossLydall) December 17, 2024\nIn addition, there is the need to upgrade Euston and Euston Square Tube stations to cope with the additional passengers in the area.\nADVERTISEMENT But Transport for London has no money set aside for expanding either station.\nIts draft budget documents for 2025/26 state: “TfL is committed to supporting the extension of HS2 to Euston, however the improvement works required to Euston and Euston Square Underground stations are not funded within TfL's plans.”\nAppearing before the Commons transport committee last week, Lord Hendy said it was “profoundly unsatisfactory” that the Government did not know how much it would cost or how long it would take to complete “phase one” of HS2.\nHe told the committee: “This new Government has to get phase one of this project under control.\n“We have got to understand how much it is going to cost, how long it is going to take and when it is going to open.”",
