    "text": "BJP slams Congress over Rs 600 crore unpaid incentives to Karnataka dairy farmers\nDairy farmers in Karnataka allege that the Karnataka government has not paid them their incentives for over six months under the Ksheeradhaare scheme. Animal Husbandry Minister K Venkatesh admitted that dues worth Rs 606.69 crore from June to October 2024 remain pending.\nIn Short\n- Karnataka farmers allege pending incentives for over six months\n- Governmentt owes Rs 606.69 crore, payments delayed due to finance clearance\n- BJP slams Congress for unfulfilled promises, farmer distress, and suicides\nFarmers in Karnataka allege that the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government has not paid dairy farmers their incentives for over six months under the Ksheeradhaare scheme, leaving them in distress.\nAs per the scheme, the government must pay Rs 5 per litre of milk supplied by farmers. Animal Husbandry Minister K Venkatesh admitted in the Assembly that incentives have been pending for the last five months due to a proposal awaiting clearance from the Finance Department.\nThe pending dues from June 2024 to October 2024 alone stand at Rs 606.69 crore. Minister Venkatesh stated that the government plans to clear the backlog in installments.\nSenior BJP leader and Karnataka Leader of Opposition R Ashoka accused the Congress-led government of failing to deliver on its electoral promises. In a post on X, Ashoka said, “Forget increasing the dairy farmers’ incentive to Rs 6 per litre as promised during elections, the government has not paid Rs 606.69 crore to farmers. This also includes dues to SC and ST farmers. More than 1,200 farmers have committed suicide in the last 18 months under the Congress government.”\nLaunched in 2008, the Ksheeradhaare scheme initially paid farmers Rs 2 per litre, which was gradually increased to Rs 5 per litre in 2016. Before the 2023 Assembly elections, the Congress had promised to raise it to Rs 7 per litre, but the increase has yet to materialise.",
