    "text": "Ask us about your TalkTalk email account and Webmail.\nSaturday\nSince Monday our Lineone email account have stopped working in Outlook and Apple Mail . Tried deleting and reinstalling without any luck. Any ideas\n6 minutes ago\nGreat stuff, in that case you should now have a working mailbox again. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.\nAdy\nPlease log in to My Account if you need to view or pay your bill, manage boosts and track your usage. From My Account you can also check your connection and test your line for any issues in the Service Centre.\n19 minutes ago\nIt was working fine until last Monday.\n20 minutes ago\nYes. I have paid 2 x Â£50 pa.\n2 hours ago\nHi Meadow65, do you have a current active paid for TalkTalk account? It sounds like your mailbox has been limited to webmail only and typically that happens when an email address isn't linked to an active account.\nAdy\nPlease log in to My Account if you need to view or pay your bill, manage boosts and track your usage.
