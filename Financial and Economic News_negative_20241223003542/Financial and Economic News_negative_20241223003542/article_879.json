    "text": "The European Commission is suing the UK for alleged violations of the terms of a post-Brexit deal on the free movement of people.\nThe commission said in a statement on Monday that it had decided to refer the UK to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) “for failure to comply with EU law on free movement of EU citizens and their family members at the end of 2020.”\nBrussels diplomats said there were “severe shortcomings” in the UK’s implementation of an EU treaty, “which continue to affect EU citizens.”\n[previously complained](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/inf_20_859)to the UK in a formal notice sent in May 2020, which said that the UK “limits the scope of beneficiaries of EU free movement law” and limited EU nationals and their family members from appealing decisions which restrict free movement.\nFree Movement and ECJ\nBrexit saw the end of the free movement of people when the UK officially left the bloc on Jan. 31, 2020. However, under the Withdrawal Agreement, EU citizens and their families who lived in or moved to the UK before that date are allowed to stay and work, granting them largely the same rights they had when the UK was still part of the EU. Reciprocal arrangements exist for UK citizens in the EU.And although the UK is no longer bound by EU laws, infringements of certain parts in the Withdrawal Agreement can be pursued by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), one of the two CJEU courts.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer’s spokesperson would not give an official government response to the court referral, saying, “I can’t comment on legal proceedings, which also relate to issues from when the UK was an EU member state and during the transition period under the previous government.”\n[reset](https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/starmer-meets-with-scholz-in-berlin-as-uk-seeks-to-reset-relations-with-eu-5714232)“ the UK’s relationship with the EU in terms of security, defence, and trade.\n‘Labour Will Surrender’\nShadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel warned the Labour government about the bloc’s legal actions, advising they “strongly” defend themselves against the claim.Patel said the bloc’s “enthusiasm to continue to take proceedings against us in the ECJ should be a warning to Keir Starmer as he tries to edge us back under its jurisdiction in more areas and extend mobility rights for EU citizens.”\nThe shadow foreign secretary continued, “Labour will surrender our sovereignty and instead of focusing on securing growth through a competitive domestic economy and global trade, they want to tie our hands up in the EU.”\nNo Return to EU Institutions\nPatel’s comments were in reference to a team formed to deal with UK–EU relations.Downing Street acknowledged that the group existed and that they were moved from the Foreign Office to the Cabinet Office “to secure the best possible deal for the UK in relation to the EU.”\n“Since coming into government, we’ve been focused on resetting our relationship with the EU to make Brexit work for the British people,” the spokesperson said.\nNumber 10 added that the government was committed to not rejoining the EU’s institutions.\nDespite the Labour Party being largely staunchly pro-EU and backing Remain in the 2016 referendum, the party pledged in its 2024 manifesto that a Starmer administration would “stay outside of the EU” and there would be “no return to the single market, the customs union, or freedom of movement.”\nThe party instead would set out to improve the UK’s trade and investment relationship with the EU, “by tearing down unnecessary barriers to trade.”\n[develop a closer economic relationship](https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/uk-needs-closer-economic-relationship-with-eu-says-chancellor-5773900)with the EU.\nReeves said conversations about deepening trade arrangements amid a wider reset with the bloc would come in the New Year.",
