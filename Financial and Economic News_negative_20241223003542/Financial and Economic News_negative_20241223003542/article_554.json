    "text": "Daijiworld Media Network - Mangaluru Mangaluru, Dec 17: An Air India flight (IX815/AUH) scheduled to depart for Abu Dhabi from Mangaluru International Airport on Monday night was delayed by 12 hours, leaving passengers stranded and distressed. The Air India flight, which arrived from Abu Dhabi at Mangaluru International Airport on Monday (Dec 16) night, was supposed to resume its return journey to Abu Dhabi at 8:55 pm the same day. However, the flight was already delayed upon its arrival in Mangaluru. Instead of departing at 8:55 pm, the flight finally took off on Tuesday (Dec 17) morning at 8:45 am â€” 12 hours behind schedule. Passengers waiting to travel to Abu Dhabi were initially informed by Air India that the flight would depart at 1 am due to technical issues. Later, they were informed of a further delay until 3 am. However, the flight eventually departed only at 8:45 am on Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, reports emerged that Air India failed to provide accommodation for passengers stranded at the airport during the long delay. While breakfast arrangements were reportedly made, no arrangements were provided for overnight stay, airport sources revealed. Disclaimer: Please write your correct name and email address.
