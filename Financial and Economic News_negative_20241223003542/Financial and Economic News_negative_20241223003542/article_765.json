The top contributors to the index's crash were HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, and TCS.\nThe market breadth was in favour of declines.\nAs many as 4,107 stocks traded on the BSE on Tuesday. Out of this, 2,442 scrips declined, and 1,576 advanced, while 89 stocks remained unchanged.\nA total of 278 stocks hit their 52-week highs while 28 stocks touched their 52-week lows.\nFurther, five stocks on the BSE hit their upper circuit limits, and just one its lower circuit.\nHDFC Bank shares ended 1.71% lower at ₹1,832.85 apiece on the BSE after the private sector lender received a second warning letter from the capital markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), within a week.\nIn an exchange filing on Monday, HDFC Bank informed that SEBI issued an administrative warning letter to the bank alleging non-compliance with the market regulator's listing regulations regarding the resignation of Arvind Kapil, the head of the bank's mortgage business.\nThe market regulator advised the bank to exercise due caution in the future and avoid the recurrence of such instances. \"Failing which appropriate enforcement action may be initiated,\" it added.\nRIL shares shed 1.8% to end at ₹1,245.10 on the BSE. It has been a listless year for the oil-to-telecom conglomerate as weak financial results weighed on the sentiment.\nShares of the company have fallen over 3% on a year-to-date basis, or so far in the calendar year, 2024.\nThe BSE MidCap index ended at 47,815.80, down 311 points, or 0.65%, while the BSE SmallCap index settled at 56,928.98, down 299 points, or 0.52%.\nAll sectoral indices ended in the red. The biggest loser was the telecom pack. The BSE Telecommunication index settled at 2,940.88, down 2.18%.\nAbout The Author\nNext Story",
