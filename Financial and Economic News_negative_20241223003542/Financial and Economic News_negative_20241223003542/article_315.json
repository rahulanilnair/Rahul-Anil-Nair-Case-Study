    "text": "SEATTLE (Scrap Monster): Steel Dynamics Inc. (SDI) released profit guidance for the fourth quarter of 2024. The business anticipates earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024 to be between $1.26 and $1.30 per diluted share. This is in contrast to the $2.05 per diluted share reported earnings in the previous quarter and the $2.61 per diluted share reported earnings in the previous year quarter.\nIn comparison to Q3, SDI anticipates that the company's steel activities will be significantly less profitable in the current year's fourth quarter. Fewer average realized pricing, seasonally fewer shipments, and an unscheduled outage at the company's Butler Flat Roll Division are the main causes of this.\nWhen compared to sequential Q3 results, Q4 earnings from metals recycling operations should be much higher due to the stable ferrous volume and flat average realized pricing. Seasonally reduced shipments and a drop in average realized pricing are likely to result in decreased earnings from the company's steel fabrication businesses.\nIn the fourth quarter of this year, the corporation bought back almost $250 million worth of its ordinary stock.\nOn Wednesday, January 22, 2025, following market close, SDI will report its Q4 2024 earnings.\nYOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:\n[Steel Dynamics FY2024 EPS Forecast Lowered by Zacks Research](/news/steel-dynamics-fy2024-eps-forecast-lowered-by-zacks-research/1/94007)\n|",
