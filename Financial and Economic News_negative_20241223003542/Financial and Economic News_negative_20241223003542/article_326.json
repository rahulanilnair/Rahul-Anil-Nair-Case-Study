    "text": "- WazirX has faced multiple allegations of misleading users, including false claims about surplus funds and withdrawal issues.\n- The introduction of Recovery Tokens (RTs) has done little to alleviate user frustration, being seen as another unfulfilled promise.\n- WazirX’s ongoing customer support failures and vague regulatory claims lead many to believe the platform is about to end.\nWazirX, one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges in India, is facing serious criticism. After several questionable actions that have left users feeling misled.\nThe Introduction of Recovery Tokens (RTs)\nA crypto influencer,[ Aditya Singh](https://x.com/CryptooAdy/status/1868572929715581156), recently pointed out multiple lies from the platform, including false claims about surplus funds, INR withdrawals, and strange user fund transactions. WazirX’s introduction of[ Recovery Tokens (RTs), ](https://x.com/WazirXIndia/status/1868911122520416400)meant to help users recover their funds, has only added to the confusion.\nRTs were supposed to allow users to benefit from things like surplus funds, recoveries from illiquid assets, and possible market growth.\nHowever, many users still determine tokens, believing they are just another empty promise. Instead of providing real solutions, RTs are a way to keep users hopeful without actually delivering anything. This has led to more frustration among customers, who feel that WazirX is only trying to cover up the real problems.\nOne of the major issues is that [WazirX](https://thenewscrypto.com/when-will-wazirx-return-if-not-now/) still does not allow users to withdraw crypto tokens to their wallets, despite claiming to be in talks with “Whiteknights” to fix the situation.\nIt was just a cover-up for user funds, which WazirX has been using to run its own business. This only makes users feel like the company is mishandling their money. Despite WazirX’s repeated claims of working on a solution, customers still await answers months later.\nThat Wazirx being the total lie if we get into the hack and analyze every bit of it, there must be the mismatching evidence for the time being it was managed but an actual thing , is they just making people to believe.\nCustomer Support Failures\nTo make matters worse, WazirX’s customer support could have been faster and more helpful but failed. Users have been waiting for long periods without getting clear responses.\nThe company keeps mentioning ongoing regulatory cases and making vague promises, adding to the frustration. Users feel that they are being misled with every new update.\nGiven all these issues, it’s becoming hard for people to trust WazirX. The Recovery Tokens might have seemed like a good idea, but with the platform’s history of misleading claims and unresolved problems, they look like just another way to delay facing the truth.\nMany people now believe that WazirX is just buying time, and the exchange may be coming to an end as its reputation keeps getting worse.",
