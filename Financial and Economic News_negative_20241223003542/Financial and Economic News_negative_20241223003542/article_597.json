    "text": "[Home](/)\n[Agriculture](/category/agriculture/)\nZimbabwean Government Fails To Pay Agreed Compensation To White Farmers\nWhite commercial farmers in Zimbabwe who lost their land under the country’s land reform programme said that the government has failed to pay part of the $331 million in compensation while reimbursing others who were not part of the agreement.\nIn a joint letter addressed to the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development, and Investment Promotion, dated December 10, 2024, the Commercial Farmers Union and the Southern African Commercial Alliance called for urgent discussions with the government.\nThe unions said that many of their members are now destitute and have lost their dignity due to the failure to receive compensation through the so-called Global Compensation Deal.\nUnder an agreement signed in 2020, the government committed to compensating approximately 4,000 White farmers whose land was seized by state-backed militants.\nHowever, it has consistently failed to meet payment deadlines, with the total expected cost of the deal reaching US$3.5 billion over 10 years.\nThe ZANU PF-led government has defended the land seizures as a means to rectify colonial imbalances, despite reports that some beneficiaries are collecting rent from legitimate farmers who are working the land.\nIn the letter seen by [Bloomberg](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/12/17/zimbabwe-fails-to-pay-white-farmers-who-had-land-expropriated/) and confirmed by the Ministry of Finance, the unions wrote:\nThe current approach risks eroding trust and undermining the structured dialogue platform’s objectives.\nWe urge your ministry to prioritize dialogue with the GCD signatories to develop a cohesive, homegrown solution that balances compensation with agricultural recovery.\nSo far, 1,300 White former commercial farmers have registered to receive compensation, according to official data.\nFor the fiscal year that ended on March 31, Zimbabwe allocated $35 million in its budget to initiate these payments. For the current fiscal year, the government has earmarked an additional $10 million.\nThe African Development Bank reports that at least 439 former landowners have been identified as beneficiaries of the financial settlement totalling $331 million.\nAndrew Bvumbe, the head of debt management in the finance ministry, said that the government will continue to make payments to farmers who seek compensation.\nMore: [Pindula News](https://www.pindula.co.zw/)\nTags\n6 Comments\nLeave a Comment\n[Generate a Whatsapp Message](https://zero.pindula.co.zw/whatsapp/?url=https://www.pindula.co.zw/2024/12/17/zimbabwean-government-fails-to-pay-agreed-compensation-to-white-farmers/?article)\nBuy Phones on Credit.\n[More Deals](/market/)\n[Feedback](/contact/)",
