    "text": "Meta Fined $264 Million in Ireland Over Facebook Data Breach By Edith Hancock Ireland's Data Protection Commission fined Meta Platforms 251 million euros ($263.9 million) on the back of a 2018 data breach that affected 29 million Facebook accounts globally, the regulator said. The DPC said Tuesday that the data leak was the result of unauthorized third parties exploiting user tokens--which are used to verify identity--on the widely-used social network. Meta didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
