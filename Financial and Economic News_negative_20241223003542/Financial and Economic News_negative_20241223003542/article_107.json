    "text": "Forestry and garden products company Husqvarna loses around 6 percent in early trading after issuing a profit warning for the second quarter in a row. The market reaction is in line with analysts' expectations.\nDanske Bank predicted a decline of at least 5 percent, while Ålandsbanken expected an even bigger fall than that, between 5-10 percent. The bank is also adjusting its estimates for next year downwards by at least 5%.\nCarnegie says it is not surprised by the profit warning.\n\"It is no major surprise, negative for the stock today, but at least partly already reflected in the share price and not necessarily an indicator for the 2025 season. The fourth quarter is seasonally the weakest quarter for Husqvarna,\" writes Carnegie.\nPareto Securities flags that it will lower its estimates for operating profit by 11-6 percent for 2024-2026 (preliminary).\n\"Although details are scarce, we expect the impact of promotional activities and inventory reduction to fade as Husqvarna enters the peak season in the first half of 2025,\" Pareto writes.\nKepler Cheuvreux expected the stock to lose 5-10 percent. At the same time, it was noted that the price pressure does not seem to be related to the growth opportunity in robotic lawn mowers, which may be seen as a small positive aspect in the profit warning, the analyst house states.\n\"We see a slow recovery of margins going forward and are 60 bps below current consensus on 2025 margins, giving a potential downside risk of at least 9 percent for ebit 2025,\" writes Kepler, which reiterates a hold and a target price of SEK 90.
