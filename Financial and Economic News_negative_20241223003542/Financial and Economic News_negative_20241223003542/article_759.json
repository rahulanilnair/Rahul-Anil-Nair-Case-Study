    "text": "The Rapidan Service Authority is aiming to raise $23M in order to upgrade the Orange County subdivision's aging sewer system Heather Price Ives Dec 17, 2024 1 hr ago 0 × Week in Virginia\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Some Orange County residents may see their water and sewer rates increase in the new year.\nThe Rapidan Service Authority has proposed increasing rates from $7 to more than $30 a month for households in the Lake of the Woods subdivision in Locust Grove.\nOrange County Review Officials float multimillion-dollar patch to mitigate sewage trouble in Orange County Heather Price Ives The 2,600-acre, gated subdivision surrounding a 500-acre man-made lake in far-east Orange County has struggled with sewage overflows due the aging infrastructure there. The additional money raised from the rate hikes is meant to cover multimillion-dollar upgrades to the sewer system.\n“What is proposed, inside Lake of the Woods only, is to increase the Lake of the Woods Vacuum Sewer fee from the current $7 per month to $10 per month. That fee pays for annual ongoing vacuum sewer system improvements and has not increased since it was enacted in 2009,” Tim Clemons, general manager of the Rapidan Service Authority, told The Daily Progress via email.\nPeople are also reading… Daughter of country music star Wynonna Judd pleads guilty to drug, theft charges in Albemarle Long-unfinished Dewberry hotel property up for sale Ron Sanchez's promotion to Virginia interim head coach came with hefty pay increase Daughter of country music star Wynonna Judd arrested in Albemarle County Years in the making, Biscuit Run Park opens this weekend Virginia football transfer portal tracker: Who is committed to the Cavaliers?

This project has an estimated cost of $23 million. The pump stations were last upgraded in the early to mid 1990-time frame. The majority of these stations need new buildings, upgraded electrical systems, upgraded and upsized vacuum pumps, new piping, new vacuum tanks, SCADA system, etc.,” Clemons said.\nShould the board approve the rate hikes, total sewer fees for Lake of the Woods residents will total $33.50 per month.\nThe Wilderness Water Treatment Plant services eastern Orange County, including Lake of the Woods, Wilderness Shores, Somerset Farms, Edgewood, Germanna Heights and Twin Lakes, as well as the Virginia Route 3 corridor.\nPENETRON “If the Board approves the rates at its January 2025 meeting, the rates will take affect with the next full billing cycle, so the February-March time frame,” Clemons said.\nA public hearing on the rate change is scheduled for 7 p.m. Jan. 8 at Locust Grove Middle School.\nHeather Price Ives\nhives@dailyprogress.com",
