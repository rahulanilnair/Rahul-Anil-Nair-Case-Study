    "text": "DUBAI: Syrian caretaker Prime Minister Mohammad Al-Bashir told Al Jazeera TV on Tuesday that Syria has very low foreign currency reserves.\nCurrent and former Syrian officials have told Reuters that the dollar reserves have been nearly depleted because Bashar Assad’s government increasingly used them to fund food, fuel and its war effort.\nThe central bank’s foreign exchange reserves amount to just around $200 million in cash, one of the sources told Reuters, while another said the US dollar reserves were “in the hundreds of millions.”\nSyria’s caretaker PM Bashir: Syria has very low foreign currency reserves\nSyria’s caretaker PM Bashir: Syria has very low foreign currency reserves\nPalestinians in Syria flock to cemetery off-limits under Assad\n“Without the fall of the regime, it would have been impossible to see my father’s grave again,” said 45-year-old Adwan.\n“When we arrived, there was no trace of the grave.”\nIt was his first visit there since 2018, when access to the cemetery south of Damascus was officially banned.\nAssad’s fall on December 8, after a lightning offensive led by Islamist rebels, put an end to decades of iron-fisted rule and years of bloody civil war that began with repression of anti-government protests in 2011.\nYarmuk camp fell to rebels early in the war before becoming a jihadist stronghold. It was bombed and besieged by Assad’s forces, emptied of most of its residents and reduced to ruins before its recapture in 2018.\nAssad’s ouster has allowed former residents to return for the first time in years.\nBack at the cemetery, Adwan’s mother Zeina sat on a small metal chair in front of her husband’s gravesite.\nShe was “finally” able to weep for him, she said. “Before, my tears were dry.”\n“It’s the first time that I have returned to his grave for years. Everything has changed, but I still recognize where his grave is,” said the 70-year-old woman.\nYarmuk camp, established in the 1950s to house Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their land after Israel’s creation, had become a key residential and commercial district over the decades.\nSome 160,000 Palestinians lived there alongside thousands of Syrians before the country’s conflict erupted in 2011.\nThousands fled in 2012, and few have found their homes still standing in the eerie wasteland that used to be Yarmuk.\nAlong the road to the cemetery, barefoot children dressed in threadbare clothes play with what is left of a swing set in a rubble-strewn area that was once a park.\nA steady stream of people headed to the cemetery, looking for their loved ones’ gravesites after years.\n“Somewhere here is my father’s grave, my uncle’s, and another uncle’s,” said Mahmud Badwan, 60, gesturing to massive piles of grey rubble that bear little signs of what may lie beneath them.\nMost tombstones are broken.\nNear them lay breeze blocks from adjacent homes which stand empty and open to the elements.\n“The Assad regime spared neither the living nor the dead. Look at how the ruins have covered the cemetery. They spared no one,” Badwan said.\nThere is speculation that the cemetery may also hold the remains of famed Israeli spy Eli Cohen and an Israeli solider.\nCohen was tried and hanged for espionage by the Syrians in 1965 after he infiltrated the top levels of the government.\nA Palestinian source in Damascus, who spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the subject, told AFP contacts were underway through mediators to try to find their remains.\nCamp resident Amina Mounawar leaned against the wall of her ruined home, watching the flow of people arriving at the cemetery.\nSome wandered the site, comparing locations to photos on their phones taken before the war in an attempt to locate graves in the transformed site.\n“I have a lot of hope for the reconstruction of the camp, for a better future,” said Mounawar, 48, as she offered water to those arriving at the cemetery.\nWestern governments open talks with Syria’s new leaders\n- Germany is coordinating closely with international partners, including France, the US, Britain, and Arab states, as Syria enters a new political phase\n- United Nations humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher also expressed optimism after meeting with Syria’s new leaders\nBERLIN: Germany, France, and other Western nations are engaging in talks with representatives of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) in Damascus, following the Islamist group’s role in the recent overthrow of Syria’s Bashar Assad. Germany’s foreign ministry confirmed on Tuesday that its diplomats would meet HTS-appointed interim government officials, joining efforts by the United States and Britain to establish contact with Syria’s new leadership.\nThe German talks will focus on Syria’s transitional process and the protection of minorities, a foreign ministry spokesperson said. “The possibilities of establishing a diplomatic presence in Damascus are also being explored,” the spokesperson added, while underscoring that Germany continues to monitor HTS closely due to its origins in Al-Qaeda ideology.\n“So far, they have acted prudently,” the spokesperson noted, referring to the group that led Assad’s ouster earlier this month, bringing an end to Syria’s 13-year civil war.\nFrance has also moved to reestablish its presence in Syria. Visiting French special envoy for Syria, Jean-Francois Guillaume, said his country was committed to supporting Syrians during the transitional period.\n“France is ready to stand with Syrians during this transition, which we hope will be peaceful,” Guillaume told journalists. He added that his delegation was in Damascus to “make contact with the de facto authorities.” An AFP journalist reported seeing the French flag raised at the embassy entrance for the first time since its closure in 2012.\nThe end of the conflict has reignited debate in Germany over asylum policies, particularly as the country took in nearly one million Syrian refugees during the war. For now, asylum procedures for Syrians are paused pending a reassessment of conditions in their homeland.\nGermany is coordinating closely with international partners, including France, the US, Britain, and Arab states, as Syria enters a new political phase.\nThe Italian Prime Minister also welcomed the fall of the Assad regime, describing it as good news and expressing readiness to engage with Syria's new leadership. While acknowledging that initial signs from the new Syrian government are encouraging, the Prime Minister emphasized the need for caution moving forward.\nUnited Nations humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher also expressed optimism after meeting with Syria’s new leaders in Damascus, including HTS leader Abu Mohammed Al-Golani, who now uses his real name, Ahmed Al-Sharaa.\n“I’m encouraged,” Fletcher said on X, adding that there is “a basis for an ambitious scale-up of vital humanitarian support.” He described the current moment as a “cautious hope for Syria.”\nIsraeli airstrikes kill 14 Palestinians in Gaza, tanks push south\nCAIRO: Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip killed at least 14 Palestinians on Tuesday, at least 10 of them in one house in Gaza City, medics said as tanks pushed deeper toward the western area of Rafah in the south.\nMedics said the Israeli airstrike on the house in the Daraj suburb of Gaza City destroyed the building and damaged nearby houses. Four other people were killed in two separate airstrikes in the city and the town of Beit Lahiya north of the enclave said medics, medics added.\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.\nIn Rafah, near the border with Egypt, Israeli tanks pushed deeper toward the western area of Mawasi, known as a humanitarian-designated area, residents said.\nHeavy fire from tanks rolling into the area forced dozens of families sheltering there to flee northwards toward Khan Younis.\nThe war began when the Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.\nIsrael then launched an air and land offensive that has killed more than 45,000 people, mostly civilians, according to authorities in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.\nThe campaign has displaced nearly the entire population and left much of the enclave in ruins.\nIsraeli defence minister says Israel will have freedom of action in Gaza after defeating Hamas\nDUBAI: Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Monday Israel will have security control over Gaza with full freedom of action after defeating Hamas in the enclave.\nMeanwhile, the Israeli military said on Tuesday that two soldiers were killed during combat in southern Gaza.\nAt least 100,000 bodies in Syrian mass grave, US advocacy group head says\n- Assad and his father Hafez, who preceded him as president and died in 2000, are accused by Syrians, rights groups and other governments of widespread extrajudicial killings, including mass executions within the country’s notorious prison system\nWASHINGTON: The head of a US-based Syrian advocacy organization on Monday said that a mass grave outside of Damascus contained the bodies of at least 100,000 people killed by the former government of ousted President Bashar Assad.\nMouaz Moustafa, speaking to Reuters in a telephone interview from Damascus, said the site at al Qutayfah, 25 miles (40 km) north of the Syrian capital, was one of five mass graves that he had identified over the years.\n“One hundred thousand is the most conservative estimate” of the number of bodies buried at the site, said Moustafa, head of the Syrian Emergency Task Force. “It’s a very, very extremely almost unfairly conservative estimate.”\nMoustafa said that he is sure there are more mass graves than the five sites, and that along with Syrians victims included US and British citizens and other foreigners.\nReuters was unable to confirm Moustafa’s allegations.\nHundreds of thousands of Syrians are estimated to have been killed since 2011, when Assad’s crackdown on protests against his rule grew into a full-scale civil war.\nAssad and his father Hafez, who preceded him as president and died in 2000, are accused by Syrians, rights groups and other governments of widespread extrajudicial killings, including mass executions within the country’s notorious prison system.\nAssad repeatedly denied that his government committed human rights violations and painted his detractors as extremists.\nSyria’s UN Ambassador Koussay Aldahhak did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He assumed the role in January — while Assad was still in power — but told reporters last week that he was awaiting instructions from the new authorities and would “keep defending and working for the Syrian people.”\nMoustafa arrived in Syria after Assad flew to Russia and his government collapsed in the face of a lightning offensive by rebels that ended his family’s more than 50 years of iron-fisted rule.\nHe spoke to Reuters after he was interviewed at the site in al Qutayfah by Britain’s Channel 4 News for a report on the alleged mass grave there.\nHe said the intelligence branch of the Syrian air force was “in charge of bodies going from military hospitals, where bodies were collected after they’d been tortured to death, to different intelligence branches, and then they would be sent to a mass grave location.”\nCorpses also were transported to sites by the Damascus municipal funeral office whose personnel helped unload them from refrigerated tractor-trailers, he said.\n“We were able to talk to the people who worked on these mass graves that had on their own escaped Syria or that we helped to escape,” said Moustafa.\nHis group has spoken to bulldozer drivers compelled to dig graves and “many times on orders, squished the bodies down to fit them in and then cover them with dirt,” he said.\nMoustafa expressed concern that graves sites were unsecured and said they needed to be preserved to safeguard evidence for investigations.",
