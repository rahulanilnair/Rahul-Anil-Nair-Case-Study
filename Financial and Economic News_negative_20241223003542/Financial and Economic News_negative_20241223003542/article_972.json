    "text": "By Madison Pearman ,\n1 hours ago\nGates Co., N.C. (WAVY) — After a bond hearing Monday morning, Kelly Earley is additionally charged with “exploitation of the elderly for financial gain.” Her bond now totals $1.5 million.\nEarley’s original charge stemmed from a Gates County Sheriff’s Office investigation.\nLaw enforcement told 10 On Your Side a scam involving Earley led a woman in her 80s to believe she owed an anonymous caller $20,000.\nThe victim withdrew the money from her bank and Earley reportedly met at the victim’s house to receive the money.\nInvestigators said the victim was subsequently contacted by Earley again for more money.\nLaw enforcement then set up a trap.\nWhen returning to the victim’s home for additional money, Earley was greeted by Gates County deputies and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation. Sheriff Ray Campbell with the Gates County Sheriff’s Office said they immediately took her into custody.\nSheriff Campbell believes Earley is a flight risk.\n“Well, we have deemed her a flight risk because she’s from Florida and she’s got ties to Missouri as well,” said Sheriff Campbell. “We feel like, for sure, if she was able to make bond that we would probably never see her again.”\nAlthough Earley is currently behind bars, law enforcement is aware there are more potential scammers to be caught. He revisited the bank in Elizabeth City that first alerted them about the incident.\n“Thank the bank teller for all they do. It was really shocking to talk with a teller and hear the tales and how many scams that they have a week, or even per day, that’s coming to them,” said Sheriff Campbell. “They’re kind of the first line of defense. So, they really help us out in that situation.”\nEarley’s next court date is set for Feb. 10.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
