    "text": "NEW YORK, Dec. 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Cassava Sciences, Inc. (\"Cassava Sciences, Inc.\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: SAVA) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Cassava Sciences, Inc. investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between February 7, 2024 and November 24, 2024. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/cassava-sciences-inc-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=116808&wire=4 SAVA investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at [jlevi@levikorsinsky.com](mailto:jlevi@levikorsinsky.com) or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Cassava's leading drug candidate, simufilam. Defendants' statements included, among other things, clear confidence in simufilam's ability to treat Alzheimer's Disease. On November 25, 2024, Cassava released topline results for the first of its two ongoing Phase 3 studies on simufilam, the \"ReThink-ALZ\" study. The results indicated that simufilam failed to meet each of the pre-specified primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints; in sum, simufilam failed to outperform the placebo. Following this news, the price of Cassava's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $26.48 per share on November 22, 2024, Cassava's stock price fell to $4.30 per share on November 25, 2024, a decline of about 83.76% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Cassava Sciences, Inc. during the relevant time frame, you have until February 10, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.
