    "text": "The operation unfolded earlier this month, when members of the Charles County Sheriff’s Office Narcotics Enforcement Section executed a search warrant at a home in the 5000 block of Vane Court.\nInside, officers discovered cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, and other drugs valued at over $30,000, along with a .357 magnum handgun, investigators said. The suspect, Adrian Carlos Farris, 35, of Waldorf, was taken into custody at the scene.\nFarris, a convicted felon barred from owning firearms, was charged with:\n- Five counts of possession with intent to distribute drugs;\n- Felon in possession of a firearm;\n- Other related offenses.\nThe day after his arrest, a judge ordered Farris to be held at the Charles County Detention Center without bond, officials said.\nWant breaking news in the DMV as it happens, or want to contribute?
