    "text": "Homepage business Economy Number of investments secured by IDA Ireland down from 2023 levels IDA Ireland secured 234 investments in 2024 which the agency said will generate 13,500 jobs in the coming years\nIDA Ireland's CEO Michael Lohan\nTue, 17 Dec, 2024 - 12:32 Emer Walsh  \n    IDA Ireland secured 234 investment wins in 2024, a decrease from the 248 investments it secured in the previous year.\nPublishing its annual performance for 2024 on Tuesday, IDA Ireland said this year's investment wins would generate 13,500 jobs in the coming years.\nThat is down significantly from the 19,000 future jobs the IDA said would be generated from the 248 investments secured in 2023.\nThere are now more than 300,000 people directly employed by the over 1,800 IDA-supported companies, equating to 10.8% of overall national employment.\nOf the investments it secured this year, almost 60% were in regional locations outside of Dublin, an increase from 53% in 2023.\nSome 69 investments were from new name or first-time investors, which the IDA said \"strongly indicated Ireland's ongoing attractiveness as an FDI location.\"\nThese included companies such as Calypso AI, Evernorth, Sirius XM, and UKG, among others.\nA record level of R&D investment valued at €1.9bn across 64 projects was approved by IDA Ireland during the year, the state agency added, with clients committing a total capital investment of €117m towards sustainability and a further €118m in training and upskilling workforces.\n\"Job growth was recorded in modern manufacturing and traditional manufacturing, up 0.8% and 0.4% respectively,\" IDA Ireland said.\n\"Business, financial and other services also reported an increase (1.7%) whilst information, communication & technology saw numbers decline (1.2%).\"\nSpeaking on its performance, Peter Burke Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said, “Despite many challenging global issues such as the impacts of Brexit, the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, Ireland continues to be seen as a location of choice for new investors as well as long-established companies who choose to further invest in substantial expansions of their operations here.\n\"Competition for FDI remains intense. Every job created in Ireland by an FDI company has been hard won, against competition from a growing number of sophisticated locations and economies.\"\nDespite strong job creation in Ireland, Mr Burke noted that domestic challenges remain and must be addressed, with the Enterprise Minister announcing that IDA Ireland will receive an additional €15.5m in capital funding next year.\nMichael Lohan, chief executive of IDA Ireland said: \"The stability in employment levels by FDI clients highlights the sector’s resilience and consistent growth, ensuring job security and economic impact.\n\"Furthermore, the significant level of capital investments into Ireland in the past twelve months from FDI crucially inject substantial capital into the country, stimulating growth and leading to the creation of highly skilled employment opportunities across the country.\"\nThis year saw expenditure within the economy by FDI companies increase by 6.5% to €38.6bn, which the IDA said showcased the \"resilience and adaptability\" of its economic framework.\nPayroll rose by 7.6% to €23.9bn, while spending on Irish services and materials grew by 4.7% to €14.6bn.\nTotal exports of €421bn marked a 7.3% increase year-on-year, while capital expenditure totalled €13.2bn, representing the second highest level on record reflecting strong levels of investment activity.\nMore in this section\nOECD report makes suggestions to improve consumer protections in Ireland Ireland urged to cut burden on professionals wanting to come here for temporary work Jim Power: Irish housing market does not need ECB's sort of interest rate trajectory  Irish exports rise to €187bn in first ten months of 2024 READ NOW Subscribe Now",
