    "text": "Automobile Škoda Auto India to hike prices by up to 3% in 2025 Share this News: Mumbai, 17th December 2024: Škoda Auto India has announced a price hike of up to 3% across its range of vehicles, effective January 1, 2025. The price increase will apply to Škoda Auto India’s entire portfolio, including the Kushaq, Slavia, Superb, and Kodiaq. The recently launched Kylaq will remain unaffected by this adjustment until it reaches the milestone of 33,333 bookings, which are fast-filling, providing customers with an extended opportunity to own the highly anticipated SUV at its introductory pricing. This adjustment is necessitated by rising input and operational costs, ensuring the company continues to deliver high-quality, premium vehicles and services to its customers.\nAs part of Škoda’s current growth strategy in India, the newly launched Kylaq plays a pivotal role. Designed to cater to the evolving preferences of Indian customers, the Kylaq combines Škoda’s new design language, comprehensive safety systems, and driving dynamics. This sub-4-metre SUV strengthens the brand’s lineup while offering a compelling new option at an accessible price point for Indian buyers. With the Kylaq, Škoda aims to achieve its ambitious target of 1 lakh cumulative sales in India by 2026, further cementing its position as a key player in the country’s competitive automotive market.\nŠkoda Auto India has also achieved significant milestones in recent years, including reaching 100,000 sales over the last two years – the shortest time the company has achieved this in the country. Additionally, the brand has expanded its presence to over 260 customer touchpoints across more than 150 cities, further reinforcing its commitment to customer satisfaction.\nContinue Reading Previous Pune: Škoda Auto Volkswagen India begins production of Škoda Kylaq Similar News Automobile Pune: Škoda Auto Volkswagen India begins production of Škoda Kylaq Automobile Tata Motors to increase prices of its passenger vehicles from January 2025 Automobile Business Tata Autocomp Systems Limited Appoints Manoj Kolhatkar as Managing Director and CEO",
