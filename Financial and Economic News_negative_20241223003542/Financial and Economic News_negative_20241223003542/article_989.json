    "text": "Canada's inflation rate came in lower than economists had expected for November\nCanada’s annual inflation rate dropped to 1.9% in November, a lower reading than economists had expected as mortgage interest costs continued to fall.\nStatistics Canada said on Tuesday morning that the consumer price index (CPI) dipped from a 2% October reading last month with the mortgage interest cost index slowing for the 15th month in a row – although mortgage servicing costs and rent increases remain the biggest contributors to overall inflation.\nRent prices were up 7.7% across the country in November compared with 7.3% in October, driven mainly by upticks in Ontario and Manitoba. Overall shelter prices have climbed by 18.9%, StatCan said, over the past three years.\nWithout taking gasoline price increases into account, the CPI accelerated by 2.2% year over year in November.\nThe national statistics agency said grocery prices remain elevated despite slowing price growth for food purchased from stores. Those costs are up 2.6% compared with the same time last year – but have spiked by 19.6% since November 2021.\nAfter surging to a 39-year high of 8.1% in the middle of 2022, inflation has been on a steady downward trajectory thanks in large part to a series of aggressive interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada.\nThe central bank has trimmed its benchmark rate in recent months with the CPI falling well within its target range of 1-3%, and Governor Tiff Macklem said on Monday that a review next year will assess whether 2% remains the best target for inflation.\nIn its final rate decision of the year last week – a 50-basis-point cut – the Bank said the current level of inflation, excess supply in the economy and the likelihood of softer-than-expected economic growth had justified an oversized reduction.\nMake sure to get all the latest news to your inbox on Canada’s mortgage and housing markets by signing up for our free daily newsletter here.",
