    "text": "By Isabel Wang\nOil prices were lower early Tuesday as traders looked toward the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates later this week as the central bank kicks off its final policy meeting of the year.\nPrice moves\n-- West Texas Intermediate crude CL.1 for January delivery CLF25 was off 71 cents, or 1%, to trade at $70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n-- February Brent crude BRN00 BRNG25, the global benchmark, lost 61 cents, or 0.8%, to $73.30 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.\n-- January gasoline RBF25 declined 0.8% to $1.96 a gallon, while January heating oil HOF25 fell 1.3% to $2.23 a gallon.\n-- Natural gas for January delivery NGF25 rose 1.1%, at $3.25 per million British thermal units.\nMarket drivers\nU.S. and global benchmark prices were falling for a second day on Tuesday, reversing some of their gains last week after economic data from China stoked concerns about weakening demand in the world's biggest crude importer.\n\"WTI crude oil futures declined [on Monday] as the combination of soft retail sales and fixed asset investment numbers out of China overshadowed the solid composite PMI reports in Europe and the U.S., and also proved to more than offset further escalations in geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine over the weekend as the latter launched a drone strike that reportedly successfully hit an important fuel storage depot in central Russia,\" said Tom Essaye, founder and president of The Sevens Report.\nSee: A huge part of the U.S. economy catapults to 38-month high after Trump win and 2025 optimism\nProviding some support for prices, the European Commission on Monday announced a 15th package of EU sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, which targets non-EU tankers that are part of Moscow's so-called shadow fleet carrying Russian oil.\nIn the U.S., traders also awaited the Federal Open Market Committee's policy decision, slated at the conclusion of the central bank's two-day meeting on Wednesday afternoon. Policymakers are widely expected to lower the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n-Isabel Wang\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.
