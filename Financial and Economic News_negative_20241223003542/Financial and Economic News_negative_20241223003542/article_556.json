    "text": "FTSE 100 down 59 at 8,202 Bitcoin goes above US$107,000 UK wages rise but unemployment steady 11.25am: Barclays (LON: BARC ) hit by adverse motor finance ruling\nBarclays was under pressure after the High Court rejected its appeal over a decision by the Financial Ombudsman related to a car finance loan.\nThe bank said it intends to appeal the decision which ruled it unfairly added £1,300 commission to a car loan arranged in 2018.\n“This challenge related to a single, specific case on which we disagreed with the Financial Ombudsman Service’s decision,” Barclays said. “We are disappointed in the court’s ruling and will be appealing.”\nCar finance has become a huge headache for UK banks with Lloyds (LON: LLOY ) and Close Bros facing potentially huge bills following a ruling by the Court of Appeal over whether commission payments should have been disclosed to borrowers.\nShares in Barclays fell by 0.8% while Lloyds dropped 1.1% and Close Bros 1.6% even though those two banks were not directly involved in today's ruling.\nFTSE 100 down 59 at 8,202.\n10.55m: No respite in FTSE 250\nLondon’s second-tier index, the FTSE 250, was mirroring its larger cousin, dropping 0.88% to 20,630 with Chemring (LON: CHG ), down 10%, and Hollywood Bowl, 8% lower, the chief culprits.\nWeapons maker Chemring was harder to explain as it reported an 8% revenue increase to £510.4 million for the year to October 31, driven by strong performances at its Roke division, which posted top-line growth of 17%.\nUnderlying operating earnings (EBITDA) were up 6% at £93.7 million, but the mood today is unforgiving with the shares down 36.5p at 325p.\n10.35am: Pound edges higher as rate cuts pushed out\nThis morning’s jobs numbers have put the cat among the pigeons ahead of inflation numbers and the Bank of England rate decision later this week.\nThe pound edged up against the dollar on talk that the rise in wages has ended any chance of a rate cut on Thursday, though hiring stats suggest that is just what the country needs according to some economists.\nThe number of job vacancies in the UK fell by 31,000 to a three-year low of 818,000 in the UK in the three months to November, adding to a run of declines that now totals 29 months.\nHopes for the next rate cut have been pushed out until May 2025 according to one economist.\nRob Wood, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “Facing this renewed trade-off between weaker growth and still strong inflation pressures the Monetary Policy Committee will keep interest rates on hold this week and will have to proceed cautiously.”\nPantheon expects three 25 basis point cuts (0.25%) next year.\nSterling rose to US$1.27 against the US dollar.\nFTSE 100 down 66 at 8,195.\n10.05am: Rolls-Royce (LON: RR ) gets upgrade on bullish outlook\nAlso on the up today is Rolls-Royce, helped by a bullish write-up from Deutsche Bank (ETR: DBKGn ), which has increased its share price target to reflect free cash flow and earnings estimates, as well as updated sector assumptions.\nAnalyst Christophe Menard noted that a potential catalyst could be an update of Rolls-Royce’s 2027 targets in February 2025, as consensus figures already surpass the company’s existing guidance.\nMenard reckons Rolls-Royce's current valuation looks low though the aerospace company “must advance its transformation programme to align its valuation metrics with competitors like General Electric (NYSE: GE )”.\nDeutsche maintained a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a share price target upgraded from 555p to 630p against 583p .\nFTSE 100 down 54 at 8,207\n9.45am: Technology Minerals (LON: TM1 ) rockets on Glencore (LON: GLEN ) deal\nEnough of the gloom this morning, time for some good news.\nTechnology Minerals shares jumped 150% as it unveiled an offtake deal with FTSE 100 mining and trading giant Glencore.\nUnder the agreement, Recyclus (Tech Min’s 48%-owned associate) will supply black mass, produced at its industrial-scale lithium-ion facility in Wolverhampton, to Glencore’s European operations.\nBlack mass is the stuff recycled from used lithium-ion batteries that is then processed to retrieve lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt that can be used again to make new batteries.\nGlencore has been spending a fortune setting up new facilities to deal in bulk with this problem of unwanted Li-ion batteries and this is a clear endorsement of TM’s processes said Robin Brundle, TM's chair.\nIt also marks its second major agreement, with a group in India also trialling the process.\n“Commercial traction for our recycling solutions continues to increase,” said Brundle (read more).\nShares in TM jumped 0.17p to 0.28p while Glencore eased 1.5% to 362,4p on China economic concerns.\n9.20am: Surprise rate cut hopes diminish after job stats, say commentators\nMore on the unemployment numbers this morning and more critically the jump in wages for the first time in a year ahead of the Bank of England rate decision on Thursday.\nCapital Economics said the rise in regular private sector pay growth in October will add to the Bank of England’s worries about a resurgence in inflation.\nAdding it had expected public sector pay deals to drive up wage growth in October, it was private sector pay deals that were mostly the reason average earnings rose to 5.2%.\n“That said, the Bank can take some comfort from the further gradual loosening in the labour market.\n\"The reliability issues of the Labour Force Survey mean that the Bank won’t read too much into the unemployment rate staying at 4.3%.\n“But it will put more weight on the 35,000 decline in the PAYE measure of employment in November and the further fall in the number of job vacancies, from 828,000 in October to 818,000 in November, which is now broadly back in line with its pre-pandemic level.”\nDanni Hewson, AJ Bell’s head of financial analysis, added: “There is still a giant question mark hanging over official jobs figures as the ONS battles to increase the number of people responding to its Labour Force Survey.\n“But even with that caveat it’s impossible to ignore the cracks that have been widening in the labour market, with vacancy numbers dropping off month after month.\n“Today’s official figures do have a few bright spots, including a slight fall in the economic inactivity rate. Wage growth also rose for the first time in over a year up to 5.2% and busting inflation by 3%.\n“For workers, getting a bit more in their pockets will be welcome, but it has pushed the door even further closed on the slim chance that the Bank of England might deliver a surprise cut to interest rates later this week.”\nConsensus is still for rates to remain at 4.75%.\nFTSE 100 down 46 at 8,215.\n8.55am: Good news in short supply as Footsie drops 60\nGood news is at a premium this morning with Footsie’s fall reflecting a string of downbeat updates and warnings.\nCapita and Hollywood Bowl have joined Bunzl (LON: BNZL ) in the doghouse with cautious trading updates.\nOutsource specialist Capita reported an 8% decline in adjusted revenue for the eleven months ending November 30, driven by exiting lower-margin service lines and lingering headwinds from the prior year. Shares fell 9% to 15.8p response (read more).\nBowling alley operator Hollywood meanwhile posted record revenues but warned that the rise in national insurance announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves would see costs per average employee rise to £1,115 from £400.\nThe FTSE 250 group is working to mitigate the impact said chief executive Stephen Burns. Shares dropped 7% to 310p (read more)\nFTSE 100 down 62 at 8,199.\n8.20am: Footsie tumbles 50 points as Bunzl takes a beating\nFTSE 100 has opened sharply lower with Bunzl leading the fallers on a cautious trading update.\nThe plastics distributor shed more than 5% at the open on a warning that profits are being hit by stickier than expected price deflation.\nRevenues on an actual basis will also be lower this year, said the FTSE 100 group.\nHopes that interest rates will fall rapidly also took a dent as wages in the UK rose for the first time in a year.\nUnemployment stayed steady at 4.3%, but wages including bonuses were up by 5.2%.\nOil groups were also a drag on the index with BP (LON: BP ) and Shell (LON: SHEL ) down by 1.4% and 1.8% respectively as the price of Brent flirted with the US$73 a barrel mark.\nLSE is the best of the risers so notching up a 1% gain.\nFTSE 100 down 50 at 8,211.\n8.05am: Bunzl prices lower than expected but volumes 'robust'\nBunzl said expects underlying revenues this year to be 3% higher than a year ago, though will be flat or down slightly on an actual basis.\nAcquisitions will be the driver, added the plastics distributables group with organic revenues seeing volumes pick up but prices are still being affected by deflation being stickier than expected.\n“This is expected to have a slight impact on group adjusted operating profit in 2024, driven by Continental Europe,” said the statement.\nGroup adjusted operating profit in 2024 will rise strongly over 2023, said the statement with margins higher than the previous year.\nIn 2025, Bunzl said expects \"robust\" revenue growth in 2025, helped by recent acquisitions ( read more....).\n7.35am: Wages rise, unemployment steady\nWages have risen for the first time in more than a year casting more doubt on potential interest rate cuts in the UK.\nUnemployment was unchanged at 4.3% in the three months to October, said the Office for National Statistics, but pay including bonuses rose to 5.2%.\nJob vacancies fell again and the number of employees on the payroll fell by 22,000 (0.1%), though employment is still up 160,000.\nThe ONS has admitted there have been issues with the reliability of its numbers, but said its estimate for November is for a 35,000 fall in payrolled employees.\n7.15am : Poor start expected in London\nFTSE 100 was tipped to open lower again after yesterday’s 38 point fall.\nFinancial spread betters were pencilling in a similar fall when markets open today with hopes for a significant Santa Clause rally looking a little forlorn.\nPlastics distributables giant Bunzl is among the early reporters and confirmed a £200 million buyback for 2025 when it also expects robust revenue growth, said the trading update.\nElsewhere, Bitcoin’s rise continues, with the price topping US$107,000 as Donald Trump reiterated plans to create a US strategic reserve for crypto similar to its oil holdings.\nBitcoin specialist MicroStrategy being added to the Nasdaq 100 index also helped sentiment for the cryptocurrency said commentators.\n5.00am: Unemployment, Bunzl and Hollywood Bowl on agenda\nUK unemployment figures are due on Tuesday, while Hollywood Bowl and Bunzl will be among those to update.\nCan Hollywood Bowl remain an unlikely bright spot...
