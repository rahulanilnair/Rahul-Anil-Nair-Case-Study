    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, unanimously approved a bill on Tuesday that tightens restrictions on income received by those Moscow has designated as \"foreign agents\".\nRussian law requires any person or organisation receiving support from outside Russia or who Moscow says is under foreign influence to register as a \"foreign agent\", a label that has negative Soviet-era connotations and brings onerous bureaucratic requirements.\nThe bill, which the Duma passed in the third and final reading, requires \"foreign agents\" to transfer all income from the sale or rental of property and vehicles, as well as interest on deposits and dividends, to special rouble accounts.\nIt also requires them to transfer to those accounts any earnings from intellectual activity, including works of science, literature and art, performances, broadcasting, inventions and trademarks.\nThe individuals concerned will only regain access to those funds once they are removed from the Justice Ministry's register of \"foreign agents\".\nThe bill will now head to the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament, and then to President Vladimir Putin for signing into law.\n\"The adopted law will prohibit scoundrels from enriching themselves at the expense of citizens and the country they have betrayed,\" Vyacheslav Volodin, the Duma's speaker, wrote on his Telegram channel on Tuesday.\nA total of 895 individuals and organisations are listed as foreign agents by Russia's Justice Ministry, including former billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Nobel Prize winner Dmitry Muratov and prominent YouTube blogger Yuri Dud.\nCRACKDOWN\nSome 209 people have had their names successfully removed from the list since Russia's first law on foreign agents was passed in 2012, Justice Minister Konstantin Chuychenko told the TASS state news agency in September.\nRussia has pursued a sweeping crackdown on dissent since it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, arresting over 20,000 people for speaking out against the war and pursuing criminal charges in more than 1,000 cases, according to human rights group OVD-Info.\nMany of Russia's \"foreign agents\" now live abroad. They are barred from holding public office in Russia and running election campaigns, among other restrictions.\nMoscow says its law on foreign agents is necessary to maintain its sovereignty amid what Putin casts as a proxy war in Ukraine between Russia and the West.\nCritics say the legislation unfairly targets those who speak out against the Kremlin and its policies at home and abroad.\nVolodin said in November that Russia was also working on legislation to tighten rules over the income of people who have left Russia and criticise the government.\n(Writing by Lucy Papachristou; editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Gareth Jones)\nBy Lucy Papachristou\nShare Â© Reuters - 2024",
