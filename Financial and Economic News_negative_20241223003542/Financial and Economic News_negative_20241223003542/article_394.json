The report revealed big players standing behind those transactions. One of them is the non-functional crypto exchange Mt. Gox.\nMt. Gox and Marathon Digital shovel 23,664 Bitcoins\nSpotonchain revealed that two entities have initiated large-sized transactions of Bitcoin, which carried 23,664 BTC in total. That amount of Bitcoin is valued roughly at $2.51 billion in fiat.\nThe first entity that participated in this was the infamous one of the first crypto exchanges – Mt.Gox. According to the shared data, this platform transferred 1,620 BTC worth $172.5 million over the last six hours. That included one 1,320 BTC transaction to its internal address and 300 BTC to B2C2 Group.\nSince early November, Mt. Gox has shoveled 7,500 Bitcoins (that’s roughly $650 million) to B2C2. Spotonchain believes that the likely goal here was to conduct creditor payouts. As of now, Mt.Gox holds 37,404 BTC in total. That’s equal to $4.02 billion.\nThe second Bitcoin mover was BTC miner Marathon Digital. It has transferred a much bigger Bitcoin chunk than Mt. Gox – 22,044 BTC valued at a whopping $2.34 billion over the last fourteen hours. That tremendous amount of crypto was spread across forty wallets, which are unidentified.\nThe Bitcoin miner how holds, $1.54 billion worth of BTC – that’s 14,364 Bitcoins.\n\"Start buying Satoshis,\" Robert Kiyosaki says\nInvestor and financial expert [Robert Kiyosaki](https://u.today/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-says-this-asset-is-next-to-surge-big-after-gold), also known for his best-selling book “Rich Dad Poor Dad”, published a tweet to highlight Bitcoin’s spike to the new record peak of $107,780.\nKiyosaki stressed that Bitcoin has been holding above $106,000 without going further down. He admitted that while hardly anyone can afford to buy a whole BTC, it is possible to stock up on Bitcoin in particles called Satoshis.\nTherefore, one can by any amount of them that one can afford. The financial expert stated that this is “the genius of Bitcoin”. Therefore, Kiyosaki urged his followers to begin buying Satoshis before these small Bitcoin particles also soar to $107,000 per unit.\nRelated articles\n[News](/latest-cryptocurrency-news)\n[\nJapan's MicroStrategy to Issue 4.5 Billion Yen Bonds to Buy Bitcoin ](/japans-microstrategy-to-issue-45-billion-yen-bonds-to-buy-bitcoin)\n[News](/latest-cryptocurrency-news)\n[\n69,300,000 XRP Hits Binance, Here’s What’s Happening ](/69300000-xrp-hits-binance-heres-whats-happening)",
