    "text": "STORY: Chinese leaders have agreed to raise the budget deficit to 4% of gross domestic product next year.\nThe number would be the highest on record.\nThat's according to Reuters sources, who also said Beijing will stick to an economic growth target of around 5%.\nThe new deficit plan compares with an initial target of 3% of GDP for this year.\nIt is also in line with a \"more proactive\" fiscal policy outlined by leading officials this month.\nThe additional one percentage point of GDP in spending amounts to about $179.4 billion.\nThe sources said more stimulus will be funded through issuing off-budget special bonds.\nThese targets are usually not announced officially until an annual parliament meeting in March.\nAnd they could still change before the legislative session.\nBeijing did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nThe stronger fiscal approach planned for next year forms part of China's preparations to counter the impact of higher U.S. tariffs.\nThey are expected to rise upon the return of Donald Trump as U.S. President in January.\nReuters reported last month that government advisers had recommended Beijing not to lower its growth target.\nThe world's second-largest economy has struggled this year due to a severe property crisis, high local government debt and weak consumer demand.\nExports have been one of the few bright spots.\nBut that could soon face U.S. tariffs over 60% if Trump delivers on his campaign pledges.\nAnalysts believe China is likely to rely heavily on fiscal stimulus next year, but could also use other tools to deal with the impact of tariffs.\nShare Â© Reuters - 2024",
