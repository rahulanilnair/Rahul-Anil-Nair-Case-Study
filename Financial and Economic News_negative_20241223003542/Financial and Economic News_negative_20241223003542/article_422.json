    "text": "CHICO — Ah yes, one of the strangest trends to emerge from fraud culture, the gift card scam.\nOr maybe I should say the gift card element to the scams because gift cards have become a mainstay in trying to rip people off. The neat thing about gift cards is you can often redeem them for cash with little to no paperwork to trace back.\nEnter the holidays when everyone is shopping for gifts and Target becomes an absolute nightmare and people run into you with their carts because they were walking while looking at their phones and it almost knocks you over into a shelf full of Lego sets — but I digress.\nThis is the time of year when scams specific to gift cards ramp up. Those emails and phone calls start to rush in from someone pretending to be your distant family member asking you to help buy them gift cards for loved ones and promising to pay you back.\nMaybe they have you send the gift cards to them via mail or more likely have you purchase them online to avoid having to get a temporary Post Office box. Either way, they’re not paying you back and you might be out $100 or more.\nMy No. 1 piece of advice here is to ignore the messages and phone calls. What makes the latter so frustrating these days is that scammers have the most access to technology that can spoof phone numbers so you may very well look at your phone and see Uncle Dave or Cousin Amber on the caller ID only to answer and get a weird automated message.\nRemember, you can always let it ring and then call the person on the ID back to confirm it was them.\nStay safe out there folks and happy holidays.\nScam of the Week generally runs every Tuesday. Readers are welcome to contact reporter Jake Hutchison to report scams and potential scams they have come in contact with by calling 828-1329 or via email at jhutchison@chicoer.com.",
