--- ROUND 1 ---

RISK_ANALYST:
  Stance: Disagree
  Proposed Sentiment: Negative
  Proposed Confidence: 80%
  Proposed Impact: Medium
  Reasoning: While the current analysis highlights global uncertainties weighing on Bursa Malaysia, I believe that the market sentiment towards potential rate cuts is overly pessimistic. Additionally, the Chinese economic slowdown may have already been factored into market expectations.
  Key Points: [Global] financial stability has improved significantly over the past decade, with central banks making concerted efforts to prevent another 2008-style crisis in the US and global markets being less connected than they initially were.

GROWTH_ANALYST:
  Stance: Disagree
  Proposed Sentiment: Positive
  Proposed Confidence: 70%
  Proposed Impact: Medium
  Reasoning: While the current analysis indicates a negative sentiment, I believe the market is actually poised for a comeback as investors digest the recent economic data and central bank decisions. The volatility in Bursa Malaysia is a natural result of the global uncertainties, but it also presents opportunities for buyers to scoop up undervalued stocks. My confidence level remains moderate at 70%, as I do not want to be overly optimistic about the market\u2019s trajectory. The impact magnitude is likely to be medium, as the market will continue to experience ups and downs, but overall positivity
