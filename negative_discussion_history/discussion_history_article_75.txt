Additionally, the impact of these factors on businesses is overestimated, given that the report emphasizes the need for businesses to adapt to changes quickly rather than relying solely on innovative solutions. growth_analyst: The current analysis highlights the struggle of UK SMEs to innovate amid budget cuts and skill shortages.
