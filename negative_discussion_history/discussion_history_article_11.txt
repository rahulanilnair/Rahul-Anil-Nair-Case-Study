Original Headline: Husqvarna falls in line with analysts' expectations - MarketScreener
Original Content: Forestry and garden products company Husqvarna loses around 6 percent in early trading after issuing a profit warning for the second quarter in a row. The market reaction is in line with analysts' expectations.
Danske Bank predicted a decline of at least 5 percent, while Ã…landsbanken expected an even bigger fall than that, between 5-10 percent. The bank is also adjusting its estimates for next year downwards by at least 5%.
Carnegie says it is not surprised by the profit warning.

INITIAL ANALYSIS:
- Headline Summary: Husqvarna falls in line with analysts
- Key Content Highlights: Profit warning for the second quarter, market reaction in line with analysts
- Initial Sentiment: Negative
- Initial Confidence: 81%
- Initial Impact: Medium
- Initial Rationale: risk_analyst: The current analysis recognizes a negative headline but notes that the market reaction is in line with analysts' expectations. Despite this, I partially agree because the profit warning does pose a risk to Husqvarna's performance. Additionally, estimates for 2024 and 2025 are being adjusted downward, which suggests some level of concern. However, the potential upside from robotic lawn mowers and a slow recovery of margins somewhat mitigate these risks. growth_analyst: While the news highlights a negative headline and profit warning, the market reaction is in line with analysts' expectations, which suggests that the company is not significantly overvalued. Additionally, the analysis mentions small positive aspects such as the growth potential of robotic lawn mowers and peak season expected to bring an improvement. This balance between negatives and positives warrants a more cautious sentiment. sentiment_analyst: I partially agree with the current sentiment and confidence ratings due to the negative headline but acknowledge that analysts expect a decline in quarters ahead. However, the overall impact seems underestimated considering potential downsides for ebit margins in 2025 and the hold recommendation by Kepler despite small positive aspects.
