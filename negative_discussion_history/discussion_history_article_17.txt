RISK_ANALYST:
  Stance: Disagree

My confidence rating is higher than 70% as I believe that with effective communication and cooperation between coalition partners, meaningful adjustments can be achieved. The proposed impact magnitude is accurate, but I would rate it slightly lower than medium due to the potential for a more positive outcome.
