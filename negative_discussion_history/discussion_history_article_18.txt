INITIAL ANALYSIS:

  Key Points: [1] The narrowing of the deficit indicates some positive movement in the country's fiscal balance. [2] The significant gap between revenue and spending remains a cause for concern.[3] Turkey's budget revenues only accounted for 92% of expenditures, highlighting a considerable mismatch.

SENTIMENT_ANALYST:
  Stance: Partially Agree
  Proposed Sentiment: Negative
  Proposed Confidence: 60%
