The controversy surrounding the fee and its implementation suggests that Entergy may be making a strategic decision to pass on the cost to customers, rather than absorbing it themselves as suggested by Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis. Furthermore, the fact that commercial customers will see a larger amount on their bills due to higher energy usage implies that the impact of the fee will not be uniformly distributed among all customers.
