Original Headline: Stamp duty to spark volatility in 2025 mortgage market: Nationwide | Financial Reporter
Original Content: "This will lead to a jump in transactions in the first three months of 2025 (especially in March) and a corresponding period of weakness in the following three to six months, as occurred in the wake of previous stamp duty changes."

Housing market activity proved resilient in 2024, despite ongoing affordability challenges, according to the latest analysis from Nationwide.
It predicts house prices to see growth broadly in the range of 2% to 4% in 2025...

INITIAL ANALYSIS:
- Headline Summary: Stamp duty changes may spark volatility in 2025 mortgage market despite housing growth predictions
- Key Content Highlights: Increased transactions and weakness in following periods after stamp duty change, economists predict 2-4% house price growth in 2025
- Initial Sentiment: Neutral
- Initial Confidence: 70%
- Initial Impact: Medium
- Initial Rationale: risk_analyst: I partially agree with the current analysis that stamp duty changes may spark volatility in the 2025 mortgage market. However, I donkey rate the confidence level of 80% as relatively low considering the potential impact of stamp duty on transactions and subsequent market weakness. The predicted 2-4% house price growth in 2025 seems overly optimistic to me, given the historical effects of similar changes. Additionally, I believe the impact should be classified as High due to the potential for increased volatility and uncertainty among buyers and investors. growth_analyst: The current sentiment is neutral and confidence at 80%, which seems reasonable given the prediction of 2-4% house price growth in 2025. However, I think the impact rating of Medium might be slightly cautious considering the potential volatility caused by stamp duty changes. sentiment_analyst: While the current analysis is neutral due to economists predicting moderate growth and market strength,
